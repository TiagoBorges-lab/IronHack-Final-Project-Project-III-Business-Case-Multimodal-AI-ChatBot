[music] In this video, I'll break down the pros and cons of emulating the PS2 version versus playing the PC remaster. If you're interested in emulation, I'll cover my recommended settings, an HD texture pack option, and my personal reshade setup. If you prefer the PC remaster, I'll go over common bugs and fixes, how to inject RTGI rate trace lighting, and my custom reshade configuration. Lastly, I'll wrap it up by comparing all the options side by side for your viewing pleasure. Now, I'm not claiming either is the definitive way to play, despite explicitly saying this in my clickbait title. GOTCHA, [ __ ] Jokes aside, my ReShade setups reflect my personal taste. You will definitely want to tweak to your liking, but this is the beauty of emulation in PC gaming. You can fine-tune everything to match your preferences. So, take it all with a grain of salt.

And enjoy the video. >> [music] >> Most people will probably prefer playing the PC remaster because the remaster features entirely reworked new handcrafted textures, improved lighting, enhanced particle effects, and a stable 60fps. Compare that to emulating. In PCSX2, you can increase the resolution to 4K. There's also an HD texture pack by Curse Arms, which is pretty good, but since it's an AI upscale of the original assets, it's not as clean as the manually redone textures in the Mars edition. For example, in this shot, the original version shows unreadable text on Jahuti's frame. The PS2 upscale pack doesn't really fix it, but in the Mars remaster, the text is fully legible. If you want to service this, use the designated fastener. Anyway, performance-wise in PCSX2, you can achieve a fairly stable 60fps via tweaking settings in the emulator, but you're still going to experience a lot of slowdown. Compared that to the PC version, in my experience, it maintained a rockolid 60fps. In terms of audio, the Mars Edition adds remastered surround sound, updated sound effects, and a fully remixed soundtrack. The trade-off is that this game is finicky with your computer audio settings. and it takes a few tweaks to get everything working correctly. So, unless you strongly dislike the new sound effects or can't stand the remix soundtrack, the PC version is superior here as well. In regards to extras, the Mars Edition includes a 3D hanger view, model viewer, full VR support, and a new very easy difficulty mode. It also has an optional proc controller profile that to me does play better. However, you can remap the controls in PCSX2 to mimic this layout, but you obviously don't get any of the other extras when you emulate the original version. In terms of reshade, reshade integration does work far better on the PC version because the depth buffer functions properly, which allows depthbased effects like RTGI lighting. On the PS2 emulator, I couldn't get the depth buffer to work reliably. So, none of those effects will work. In conclusion, unless you are hellbent on mimicking the original experience, in which I would just say emulate at native resolution and throw a good CRT filter over it. Outside of that, the only real advantage in my opinion to emulating on the PS2 is that with 8K super sampling, you can achieve, ironically, a slightly crispier image compared to the PC remaster. However, the remaster superior textures, stable 60fps, remastered audio, and all the extras make the Mars Edition my preferred way to play. That said, if you do want to go the emulation route, I'll go over my PCSX2 settings next. If you've never used PCSX2 on my channel, I have a video called a basic setup guide for PCSX2. Link below. Now, Zone of the Ender 2's native resolution is 512x448, which on a modern monitor, it's going to look pretty pixelated, but before we fix that, let's do some basic settings. Go over to settings, emulation, and under EE cycle rate, set it to 300% overclock, and I set my normal speed to 110%. just makes the game stay slightly above 60 fps, doesn't really mess up the audio, and helps you deal with a little bit of slowdown. Also, 300% overclock on EE cycle rate, optimal frame pacing, sync to host refresh rate, and if you don't have G-Sync, check vertical sync, and it should get you the smoothest frame rate possible, but as mentioned previously, you will still have a little bit of slowdown. Next, go to graphics. Internal resolution set to the closest interval that matches your monitor's resolution. I have a 4K monitor and a GPU that can handle it. So, I go all the way to 8K for super sampling, which gives me the sharpest image possible. However, even at 8K, you're going to notice, wait a minute, this looks really blurry. Well, that's because PS2 games often use intentional blur as a form of anti-aliasing. To fix this, go back to the display tab under graphics and check anti-blur. Now it's going to look much sharper. The next thing we want to do is the HD textures. Google Zone of the Enders 2 texture pack, which will take you to this GBA temp.thread, where the author Curse Arms showcases his texture pack. The link for it is in this YouTube video, and then you'll find the actual Google Drive link. I put this link in the description below. Download this, then extract it. Inside you'll find a folder titled slus20545. This is the North American version which you have to be running in order for the texture pack to work. If you don't know what version you're using, go to settings, game properties, and under serial, it will tell you which version you're using. Take the sluss 20545 folder and put it in documents PCSX2 textures. Head back to your game. Go to settings, graphics, texture replacement, and check load textures. Now we have 4K upscaled textures. The last step is installing ReShade. If you've never used ReShade before, check out my video how to install ReShade on PCSX2, which will be linked down below. Once that's set up, press home. This will bring up your ReShade options. And for this game, I use AMD Fidelity Contrast Adaptive Sharpening. That plus the 8K super sampling gives me a very crisp image. I use levels for a little bit of color correction. I add a slight vignette. Personally, I like it. DPX makes the colors pop a little bit more. And then I use levels plus to crush the blacks for my final image. Now, I have a very heavy-handed taste when it comes to reshade. Obviously, you can adjust to your personal preferences. And that's it. This is my personal settings for emulating on PCSX2. Next, we're going to get into fixing issues and my settings for the PC Mars Remastered Edition. Let's do it. >> All right, first things first. In the options menu under graphics, if you have G-Sync, obviously turn off VSYNC. I set my textures to 100%. It's going to give you the highest resolution textures. Fine. Fine. YBIS quality is the lighting effects. Normal is the highest. Anti-aliasing, TAA is the highest. reflections. SSR is the highest. SSAO, yes, you want that. Cloud effects. The big thing is still photo mode. What this does is a lot of the cutscenes have this crazy blurring effect. If you like that, turn this off. If you don't like that and you want a crispy, clean cutscene, turn still photo mode on. Motion blur. I'm not a huge fan, but you need a little bit of it. So, I set it to medium. And I definitely think film grain is a bad look. This game is super sharp and clean. Don't think film grain helps it. And that's it for the basic settings. Now, you're going to notice, as mentioned before, the game has this crazy audio distortion. Check this out. Yeah, that's not going to fly. If you Google Zone of the Enders 2 sound fix, you're going to find this Steam thread that long story short says if you change your sound to 24bit by 48 Hz studio quality, that should fix it. That's also confirmed in the PC gaming wiki, and that's also what fixed it for me. In order to do that, you're going to come down and click on your speaker icon and go to sound settings. Choose where your sound is coming out of. And under format, you should have the option 24bit 448 studio quality. I don't because I use a separate interface. So for me, I have to bring up my audio fuse control center and I change the sample rate here to 4,800. Either way, 24-bit 4800 will fix your sound issues. All right. The only other thing that I'm running is ReShade. Go to reshade.me. Download the newest version at the time of recording is 662. Once that's done, hit install. Scroll down, find Zone of the Enders 2, Second Runner Mars. Hit next. It is DirectX10 1112. Hit next and continue on to install all of the plugins. I've already done it, so I don't need to show you that. Once it's installed, you will not have by default the RTGI plugins that I mentioned previously. To get those, you're going to go to marty'sods.com. You do have to be a patronon to get these. It's only five bucks. If you want to, you can spend five bucks, be a patron, download the stuff you need, and then cancel. I think it's worth five bucks. I also continue to support him cuz he makes great stuff. Click on Patreon, you'll get access to his Discord. In the Discord, you're going to go to downloads level one. That's the $5 tier. And you're going to download Immerse Pro2509. This is the newest one at the time of recording. Once that's downloaded, you're going to extract it. You're going to see a folder that says textures and a folder that says shaders in your installation for Zone of the Enders. After you install reshade, you're going to see a folder called reshade shaders. Open that. You're going to see shaders and textures. Also, you're going to open textures, open textures, and you're going to drag immerse into here and copy that. Then you're going to open shaders, open shaders, and drag immerse into here and copy that. Once you are done, you hit home to bring up your reshade. In order to get the depthbased stuff to work, you need to get the depth buffer detecting properly. In this game, it's very easy. Click add-ons. Check draw call number D32. The one that has more draw calls. This one says zero. This one says about 170. It's kind of moving around. Check that. Come back to home. Search for display depth. What this does is it shows you the geometry on the left and your depth on the right. What you want to do is adjust it so the things that are closest to you are black and the things that are farther away from you are white. The gradient shade is your depth. This is set at default. If you want to change it and make the depth a little bit different, click on edit global pre-processor definitions. And this first option, reshade depth linearization far plane. By default, it is at a,000. I leave it at default for this game, but you can change it. And I'll show you what happens if I set this to 100, and hit apply. Now, you see the depth is much more shallow. Everything is white. If you make it too far, like 10,000, then everything is close to black. So, I think the default setting of a,000 is pretty close. be somewhere between 800 to 1,100. I would recommend you can turn display depth off. The next thing is you have to find immerse launchpad. Search that, check it, and move it to the top. This has to be at the top. After that's done, if you search up here RTGI, you're going to have diffuse and specular. Turn on both of those. Now you have your lighting. Now you can adjust these. For this game, the default settings work really well, but just so you know, you can come down to the bottom and you can adjust object thickness. I have it a little bit lower than default. The way that I chose this is come down to debug view. Change this to diffuse RTGI. This is going to show you how the lighting looks. If I go to object thickness is you want to go as low as you can without making the image grayed out. So the lowest possible setting where it still looks right. And for me that's about 1.65. Anywhere between 165 or 2550 is going to get that correct. And that's all you have to do. Now, I also add DPX, which makes the colors pop a little bit. Levels, adaptive sharpen. Look at the difference of this. I'm going to I'm going to zoom in and show you the difference. Look at Jehut's spine in the textures right here. If I click adaptive sharpen, look how much clearer that gets. Off. On. Off. On. I have the sharpening strength a little bit above default. I boost it up to 1.37. Please adjust this to your personal taste. This is what's awesome about ReShade. Just do it the way that you like it. I also add a little bit of MX AO. It adds a little bit more ambient occlusion. And that's it. That's all I got. Let's do some comparison shots. [music] Everybody [music] [music] [music] [music] heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXsHc0IUzLY,youtube_transcript,nXsHc0IUzLY,"Behold how to remaster Legend of Legaya. [Music] In this video, I'll go over my Duck Station settings, an HD texture pack option, how to get 60 FPS with lossless scaling, and some CRT shaders I like. In other words, I'll show you how to give Legend of Leg. Keep in mind, I am not claiming this is the best way to play, but rather how I play. Take what you like, discard what you don't, and take it all with a healthy grain of salt. Also, keep in mind emulators and various software mentioned in this video will receive updates and potentially change in the future, rendering some instructions out of date.

I say these things in the name of me, the father, KJ, the son, and Carmarmac, the Holy Ghost. Amen. And enjoy the video. [Music] I am running the North American NTSC version of the game on the Duck Station emulator. First, Legend of Leg's native resolution is a whopping 320x 228, which on a modern 4K monitor or TV is going to be so pixelated you'll wonder, how did we ever play this back in the day? Well, in the past, using original hardware on ICRT TV, the pixelation wasn't so apparent. If you'd like a more modern approach, first under the Duckstation settings, graphics, I set the aspect ratio to 16 by9 and enable widescreen rendering. This will force the game to render outside of the original aspect ratio without stretching the image. The only downside is occasionally you will see geometry that is not rendered on the edges of the screen. However, for this game, it is very minimal. Next, under settings, graphics, I set the internal resolution interval slightly above my monitor's resolution. Since I have a 4K monitor and I like to super sample, I choose 12x. You should choose the interval that closest matches your monitor's resolution. This will render at a much higher resolution, which already starts to look more how you probably remember it as a kid. However, you'll notice that the famous PS1 wobble at higher resolutions is greatly exaggerated. If you don't like that, under settings, graphics, enable PGXP, depth buffer, and all of the options under the PGXP tab. The depth buffer option will cause a few small visual glitches, but it fixes much more than it causes. And even with all the PGXP options on, you will still see some wobble, like the door at the back of the village in the opening scene. As for the rest of my settings in Duck Station, everything else is pretty much just left at default. I do map the speed toggle to my tab key and set it at 3x game speed to help with some of the grindy nature of these old JRPGs. Anyway, this gets the game looking pretty saucy if you ask me, but we can make it look better with HD textures. [Music] Now, the textures shown are authored by Curse Arms and available on gbat.net. There is a link below in the description. Grab the texture pack, extract it, and place it in the duckstation textures folder, which by default will be documents duckstation textures. Make sure the extracted folder matches the serial number of the game, which is SCUS 94254. Then under settings, graphics, texture replacement, enable the cache, preload, and texture replacement options. This replaces the original textures with upscaled versions. And for most parts of the game, I think it looks good. However, with many PS1 games, the original textures were so low resolution that the results can vary. Particularly, you'll notice seams between textures that you did not notice before. As such, I think there needs to be a bit more love to make this all come together. But first, we cannot rest until we achieve 60fps. [Music] Like most PS1 titles, the only way to achieve 60 fps in Legend of Lega is by using a third-party program called lossless scaling. Before starting, go to settings, graphics, advanced, and in Duckstation, ensure the emulator is in borderless full screen mode as lossless scaling will not work otherwise. Open loss of scaling, select the newest frame generation model, set the mode to adaptive, and target your monitor's refresh rate. Click scale and tap back to your game. While most video platforms don't support displaying 120 plus FPS, trust me when I say there is something incredibly saucy about seeing classic PS1 games run at 120 plus FPS on a high refresh rate monitor. Even if these are quote fake frames, the result is buttery smooth. Hello cladies. This makes the game look fantastic, but we can touch it up with a bit of CRT magic. [Music] Duckstation offers a variety of built-in CRT shaders under settings post-processing, which includes many popular shaders right out of the box. However, I still prefer to use Shader Glass for two main reasons. Number one, it comes bundled with my favorite shaders by Retro Crisis, which currently don't work with DuckStation. And number two, it allows you to adjust the input pixel size to control down sampling. Using shader glass is simple. Download it from the link below. Under input pixel size, you can set your downsampling rate. A higher number results in a lower output resolution. For Legend of Lega, I find that the HD textures look best with the pixel size set around 1080p. This keeps the game much, much sharper than the original resolution, while the CRT shader and slight downsampling cover the seams that become noticeable with the HD texture pack. My current two favorite shaders for this game are either the PlayStation Dirty Shader by Retro Crisis or the Mega Bezel shader with reflective edges. And that's it. That's as far as I know how to push Legend of Lega. At this time, remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed. I say these things in the name of me and Mo the Father, Kim, the Son, and Carmarmac, the Holy Ghost. Amen. And enjoy the comparison shots. [Music] [Music] Doo doo. [Music] Heat. Heat.

In this video, I will go over which version of the game I play, my emulator settings, patches to use, texture pack options, reshade injection, and even CRT shaders. Or in other words, I'll show you how to give Rogue Galaxy the sauce. Keep in mind, I am not claiming this is the best way to play, but rather how I play. Take it all with a healthy grain of salt.

I say these things in the name of Miam the father of the son and Carmarmac the Holy Ghost. Amen and enjoy the video. [Music] There are four versions of the game you can choose from. The original Japanese version released December 8th, 2005. The North American version released January 30th, 2007. The Japan only director's cut released March 21st, 2007. the European version released September 7th, 2007. And lastly, the PS4 re-release, which came out December 5th, 2015. I don't see any reason to play the original Japanese version outside of being a collector or a super fan because all of the other versions are widely considered to be better for various reasons. The North American version at release was dubbed quote the perfect version by localization producer now Higo due to a rebalanced difficulty, improved graphics, a new planet, characters, items, missions, more dialogue, and tons of other improvements. All of this was carried over into the Japanese-only director's cut version, which is really the same as the North American version, but with Japanese voiceovers and text. The European version is also the same as the North American and the Director's Cut versions with a few small differences in damage calculations. Nothing you would notice in your average playthrough. Both the North American and European versions of the game have a 60fps hack. The difference being in the PAL versions, both cutscenes and gameplay are unlocked to 60fps, while for the NTSC version, only gameplay is unlocked to 60 fps. Plus, in my testing, I couldn't even get the patch to work for the NTSC version at all. Furthermore, both European and North American versions also have a texture pack option, albeit from different authors. However, the PAL texture pack is almost double the size compared to the NTSC texture pack. I would assume it's because the textures are less compressed and of higher resolution, as it does look superior to me when I compare them side by side. And lastly, the PS4 version does run at 1080p, has trophies, and is really convenient if you just want to play it on a console. Taking all this into account, I recommend emulating the PAL version with PCSX2 as you get the bigger texture pack, 60fps in gameplay and cutscenes. Plus, if you want the Japanese voiceovers, but English menus and text, there is an undubbed version of the PAL release by Salvaria team available online, and that is what I ended up using. You get all the sauce options, plus OG Japanese voices. And without further ado, let's get into emulating on PCSX2. [Music] If you have never used PCSX2, check out my basics setup guide linked below to get started. Alrighty then, let's get into my PCSX2 settings. But first, we're going to change a few things in the actual game. I'm going to hit triangle, go to system settings, and I'm going to change my camera rotation up and down and left and right to reversed. What it calls normal is what most people call inverted. Now, I also like to turn off the mini map and the compass for a cleaner image. The next thing you're going to notice is the game's native resolution of 512x448 by today's standards on a modern 4K monitor is going to look pretty bad. So to fix that, we're going to go to settings, graphics, rendering, and under internal resolution, I check 8x for 5K. My monitor is 4K and my GPU can handle it. So I super sample up to approximately 5K. But if your GPU cannot handle it, then pick the interval that matches closest to your monitor's output resolution. and that gets the game looking pretty good. But you'll notice it's still a little bit blurry. That is because a lot of old PS2 games had intentional blur as an anti-aliasing method. To fix that, go to display and simply check anti-blur. And that gets the game looking pretty stacked, but we can do more with patches and hacks. [Music] All righty then. We are going to enable three different patches or hacks. To do this, it is in a slightly different spot. You're going to go to settings, game properties, patches, and enable the widescreen 16x9 patch, which is already enabled. Remove black bars. This sort of works. It's supposed to remove the black bars and cutscenes. So far, in my testing, it works in some cutscenes and not in others. And 50/60fps. Now, there's a couple tweaks to this. in order for the widescreen patch to work once you've enabled all of them. You have to go to settings, graphics, and make sure apply widescreen patches is applied here. Now, for the 60fps to work under emulation, you have to have your EE cycle rate set to at least 180%. And the last thing you have to do is this will not work if you do not select the right option at the beginning of the game. So, I'm going to go to system, reset, choose English, and then right here, I have to choose the 60 Hz NTSC, which is a little bit confusing because we're running the PAL version of the game, but we want to choose to run it in the NTSC mode. This is the way that we can get 60fps in both gameplay and cutscenes. And that's it. Now, we're running the game in 4K 60fps with some, if not most, of the cutscenes having the black bars removed. And it gets the game looking even more stacked. But we can add some special sauce with texture packs. [Music] If you've never swapped textures with PCSX2, there is a great tutorial by Warped Polygon linked in the description below. The short version is download either the Ice Bullet texture pack if you are playing the North American/ NTSC version or the Ivy Rock pack if you are playing the PAL/European version. Both are linked in the description below. Place either of the extracted folders named the serial number of the version you are playing. So for North America it would be SCUS 97490 and for Europe it would be SCS 54552. Place them inside PCSX2's texture folder which by default is going to be located under documents PCSX2. Then go to settings graphics texture replacement and enable load textures. Full disclosure the recommended Ivy Rockck pack is currently behind a payw wall. Personally, I have bought this pack and all of his texture packs and have no issues paying the community for their work. However, Ivy Rock has been accused of stealing from other texture authors. I don't know if this is true or not. An accusation isn't necessarily a guilty verdict, and I've not seen anyone claim this particular Rogue Galaxy pack contains any stolen work. As such, I thought about uploading this pack and maybe his other packs and providing them for free, but since I don't know the whole story, I decided not to. I will tell you this, somebody else has already done it. If you really want this or any of his packs for free, you can get them. I'll leave it at that. Comparison wise, both packs look very similar, particularly when it comes to the characters. The biggest differences you will see are in the environment textures. Depending on the scene, I find myself sometimes leaning towards Ice Bullets Pack and sometimes leaning towards Ivy Rocks Pack. However, because Ivy Rocks pack works on the PAL version, which allows 60fps in both gameplay and cutscenes, that's what I ended up deciding on. Uh, I've got to fix one thing I forgot to mention. The recommended setting for this game on PCsx2.net for the blending accuracy is full. If you set it to full, you're going to see some weird kind of blooming, and you're also going to see weird lines like you see right here. If you set it to maximum, which is supposed to be the highest quality, it looks even worse. minimum is the only thing that has no visual glitches. Again, this is only an issue to change if you are using the texture pack. If not, set it to full as recommended. All in all, this gets things looking pretty highrade, but we can do more with reshade. [Music] First, to snag ReShade, go to reshade.me. Click download the newest version. At the time of recording, it is 6.4.0. Unless you're using a shader toggler, you do not need to get the add-on support version. Once it's downloaded, double click the .exe. It's going to bring you to this screen. Browse to the application you'd like to install it to. For this video, it's the PCSX2 emulator, which I will install to the PCSX2-QT. Once that's done, I'm going to hit next. On this screen, it will depend on which renderer you use when emulating. I almost always use Vulcan, so I'm going to check Vulcan. But if you're not sure, navigate to your PCSX2, click settings, graphics, and under renderer, it will tell you which one you're using. For most games and most reshade setups, it will not matter. You can use Vulcan, OpenGL, DirectX12, or DirectX1. As mentioned, I use Vulcan. So, I check Vulcan. Then, I hit next. On this screen, it's easier to install all of the effects. So, click uncheck all, then check all, which will enable all of the effects. Then, press next. and you're going to see a screen as it installs. Then when it's installed, just click finish. Navigate back to your PCSX2 folder and you should see a new folder called reshade-shaders. Double click into that and you'll see two folders, shaders and textures. If you install any other third-party shaders, take the shaders and place them in the shaders folder and take the textures and place them in the textures folder. Once you are in your game, to open reshade, press home and you can start picking and choosing which plugins to use. All right, let's get into my personal reshade settings. Hit home to bring up the reshade menu. Long story short, I tried to inject RTGI lighting, ambient occlusion, but the depth buffer does not detect properly in this game, which means I ended up doing just a couple things. I use the plug-in levels for color correction. This has already been adjusted to what I like. This just crushes the blacks and makes the colors pop a little bit more. I use vignette. I like it. A lot of people don't, but I do. And last but not least, I use AMD Fidelity Contrast Adaptive Sharpening or CAS to add just a really subtle amount of sharpening to the image. And I'm really liking the way this looks right now, but we can give it one more drop of extra sauce with CRT filters. [Music] Let's get into CRT filters. At ReShade, you're going to have a bunch of CRT options. The ones that I personally like is CRT Royale. You see here, that looks pretty good. If you want a dirtier CRT, CRT New Pixie looks super dirty, retro, and old school. And last but not least, I also like CRT fake lots. And also, there's way more filters you can add to ReShade, but there's a few that I really like that currently do not work with ReShade, and that is the Retro Crisis CRT shader pack. In order to use those, we are going to go to Google and type in Shaderlass. Go to the first link, which is a GitHub link. Come down here and download the newest version of Shader Glass. At the time of recording is 1.14. You're going to doubleclick the .exe and run it. When it pops up, I'm going to go to shader, choose from library, scroll down to Retro Crisis, open that. And for me, because I'm on a 4K screen and I liked curved warping for my CRT shaders, I'm going to come into 4K curved. The one that I personally like the most is PlayStation Dirty. So, I'm going to choose that. Then, I'm going to hit control shiftG to make it full screen and overlay it. To me, this reminds me of a GX TV I had when I was a kid. And there we go. That's it. Those are all the tips and tricks I know how to do a DIY remaster for Rogue Galaxy. Take what you like, disregard what you don't. Remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and ye shall be blessed. I say these things in the name of Miamoto the father, Kojima the son, and Carmarmac the Holy Ghost. Amen.

version over the PS3 version go over graphic settings texture pack options and my preferred reshade setup keep in mind I'm not claiming this is the best way nor the way you should play but rather how I play there will be choices I make that don't align with your preferences but that's okay just use what you like disregard what you don't if you want to support the channel like subscribe and hit the notification button drop a comment check my link tree or back me on patreon and with that out of the way let's look at how I play God of War [Music] II I don't choose to emulate the PS3 HD remaster for three reasons RC PS3 doesn't support texture replacement it's less convenient and it doesn't look as good now rpcs3 might support texture packs in the future but for now that is only available on pcsx2 it's not to say that R pcs3 is not a great emulator because it is it's just less mature and therefore less convenient setting it up installing games and tweaking settings is all more difficult and timec consuming without the reward of better visuals because when I compare the two pcsx2 looks better there are a few things about the PS3 version I like such as blood particle effects and some lighting but overall I think uid in on PC sx2 particularly with texture packs is Far and Away a better way to [Music] play before we Tinker with any other emulator settings make sure in the actual game options to enable widescreen and progressive scan if you don't you could waste time trying to figure out why the widecreen patch in pcsx2 doesn't prevent the image from being stretched only to realize many swear words and hours later it's because there is no widc screen patch the game has a native option for it that would be pretty dumb of you and I definitely didn't do that profound sadness sadness sadness when you scale the resolution in interlaced mode the image comes out blurry but it can be cleaned up by checking anti-blur however when progressive scan is enabled it negates the need for this in the first place and has a clear image the next wrinkle you may notice is when running the internal resolution anywhere above about 3 to 4X you might run across this line that will occasionally appear just force a bilinear filtering and it should go away the last tidbit I ran across is when using one of the texture packs if blending accuracy was set to high or maximum which is usually a good thing if your PC can handle it I would encounter this really weird transparency issue but by setting the blending accuracy to medium it solved this issue for me and that's that next is texture packs now for God of War II there are many texture packs available and I tested four different runs from the following authors blackand Panda Venom XX the Roco xx and petto God of War now the first three are AI upscaled packs using different models but the end result honestly is fairly similar if you want to retain the original aesthetic of the game albeit with sharper textures any of these three will do the trick the downside is you'll notice that that quote AI look is present here and there however it's minimal and in motion I rarely noticed it now the last texture pack by projetto God of War looks to be mostly a manual rework from the ground up the only texture I found that is obviously an AI upscale is this background texture shown here however by comparing many different scenes it's obvious that the bulk of these textures are original and not AI upscales this pack is an aggressive reworking and the difference between the native textures and these textures is significant this pack will also censor various scenes in the game which could be a plus or minus depending on your preferences I do recommend this pack but there are three downsides at the time of recording it's not finished and is only complete up to the Temple of the Fates as mentioned it also drastically Chang the look of the game subjectively I love it but your mileage might vary and lastly it makes the game overall much darker you can use the emulator's postprocessing to compensate for this or you can use [Music] reshade for this game I could not for the life of me get the depth buffer to detect properly which really sucks because otherwise I would have been able to inject rtgi rage Trace lighting and that would have taken this to a Godlike Next Level pun intended so I was a bit disappointed but ultimately I used DPX levels and adaptive sharpening all tweaked to my personal preference which I think made it look better but let's see how it all comes together [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] well brothers and sisters this is as far as I could push God of War II at the time of recording there are heavy rumors that Sony is going to be releasing a remaster or remake for the Greek Trilogy and if that comes to PC then I'm sure with mods it will end up being the way I choose to play in the future if you'd like to see more gameplay footage with my settings I do have a settings Showcase Video for God of War I otherwise remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of moto the Father coim the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IOdts-CszU,youtube_transcript,_IOdts-CszU,"behold how I play the moderate hidden PS1 gem silent bomber in this video I will be going over how to get duck station my settings for resolution pgxp geometry correction frame rate widescreen and lossless scaling frame generation remember this is just how I play I'm not claiming it's the best way to play nor the way you should play so take what you like and disregard what you don't and also I do not claim clim to be the uh Guru of emulation there will be decisions I make that you think are suboptimal just take it all with a grain of salt if you'd like to support the Channel please like subscribe and hit the notification button check out my link tree potentially join my patreon or look at my other social media profiles and that's it let's get into it how I play Silent [Music] bomber all righty then the first thing that you're going to do is go to duct station. org it's going to look just like this whatever platform you have I have Windows I'm going to click that I'm going to download it I'm going to unzip it and install it wherever you want now once you install it the folder is going to look like this you want to click on Duck station- QT that's the version that has a gooey a graphic user interface when you open it up it's going to look like this you're probably not going to see any games initially that's very simple go to system settings game list it's going to bring this up and right here you can set set where you want your games to be so wherever your silent bomber game or any other games are wherever you want to keep them just set this here then click rescan all games and all your games will show up the other thing that you're going want to do is you have to have a bios or bios file I cannot tell you where to get that but it's very easy just look it up once you get that done go to settings folders and hit bios and the same thing right here under duck station will search for bias images in this directory you can browse and set it to wherever you want wherever this to set by default or change it somewhere where you want custom put your bias file in there then hit the refresh button and then everything will work correctly once that's done you're going to come down to your game silent bomber where are you I'm blind right here and once we click it here we are we're playing around now I have my controller already set up if you're playing for the very first time and you have not mapped your controllers go to settings controllers click on controller Port one pick the type of PlayStation controller you'd like to emulate I almost always choose analog controller then click on your d-pad press up on your controller left here right here down here and just map everything and you're good to go now I'm playing around now the next thing that I'm going to do is the native resolution of 320x 224 on a modern screen that's not a CRT is going to look really pixelated so I'm going to go to settings graphics and under the rendering tab internal resolution I turn it all the way to 12x which is slightly above 4K because not every base resolution is going to be proper 4K and I have a good enough GPU to handle it it's called super sampling helps with aliasing it labels 9x for 4K but if you look at the the resolution for 9x it's 2880 by 2016 that's actually not quite 4K this is just the guess because lots of games have different base resolutions so normally I hit it to 12x that puts me at 3840 by 2688 that is closer to 4K and here we go now I'm playing in 4k the next thing that you're going to notice is uh the original aspect ratio is not what we're used to some people like it but if you don't like it go to settings Graphics rendering aspect ratio I like to do 20 by9 because I like the um the WID screen not all PS1 games can do it cuz they don't render geometry that far out but silent bomber does for the most part so I'm going to hit 20 by9 and make sure that I check the WID screen if I don't check this widescreen rendering hack it's going to stretch everything I check that everything looks good now I'm playing in 20 by9 widescreen and you'll see a little bit of pop in not too bad if that bothers you just switch it down to 16x9 now the next thing you're going to notice is some people like the PS1 wobble that you can see here in the Shimmer and how you know kind of up here right next to this wall see how it shimmers and Wobbles and texture seams break in and out some people like that some people don't I prefer to fix it we can fix it go to settings graphics and under the rendering tab check pgxp geometry correction do not check depth buffer for some games that works for 80 90% of the games this is going to cause problems and then under the pgxp tab I check everything but vertex cach and CPU mode now CPU mode and vertex cach can fix some things here and there it's game specific duck station will tell you if this game needs it or not it's not always right so just experiment yourself if you're still seeing things that are not quite fixed you can play with CPU mode play with vertex cache so here you go now the geometry is much more stable we still get a little pop in right here for example CPU mode no didn't quite fix it vertex cache didn't quite fix it depth buffer and look at that so again let's take the depth buffer off you can see that this geometry is clipping and not looking right put it back on now it's looking now the depth buffer as I mentioned can cause other problems like if you look at the shadow right here it's breaking if I turn the depth buffer off the shadow looks correct so you kind of have to choose which options are the best every game's a little bit different but those are the things that you're going to play with now it's looking really solid loving it all right the last step is getting this game to run in 60fps I'm going to go over a couple things that don't work for this game but sometimes work for other games just so you're aware of them really only one thing sometimes you can go to settings emulation console and you can enable clock speed control which overclocks the uh emulated CPU so I already have it set to 200% I can go all the way up to 1,000% and you'll see here under G this is the frame rate of the game and this is the frame rate of the the display but the game still only running at 30 frames a second no matter how much I overclock the CPU so I just put at 2 100% which maybe helps me maintain a stable frame rate because this game does have some slowdown with lots of explosions but unfortunately we can't do that for 60 frames a second and a lot of times that speeds the game up anyway so it works occasionally just want you to be aware of that so the next thing that we can do is we can get a mock 60fps by opening up steam there's a program called lossless scaling at the time I bought it it was six bucks I think it's pretty cheap I'm going to launch it it's very very simple I'm going to set my frame gener ation to 3.0 that's the newest one and only 2x you might be attempted to go to X4 but I have found that X4 only works if the game is 60 FPS and you want to go to like 120 144 30 fps to 60 I do X2 otherwise you get lots of weird aliasing and like warping issues and all you have to do is make sure that you're running your game in Window mode not exclusive full screen otherwise loss of scaling will not detect it which took me forever to figure out so save your yourself sometime and uh oops that's the wrong lost of scaling tab simply hit scale and then come back over to your game now my game is running in 60fps there's how there's one problem my recording software OBS does not pick up the generated frames on display because it's actually it's it's a different window and it's not really on your display I've gone down this Rabbit Hole a thousand times if any of you have any advice normally what I do is I set up a new window on OBS and then capture that window on top of the display and then merge those two together and I can get the extra frames but I couldn't get that to work with the new Windows update so what I've done is I've interpolated the footage that you're watching to let you see what it looks like with lossless scaling but unfortunately I can't show you in real time with the way that OBS captures lossless scaling frames until I figure it out but either way what this does is this gives you interpolation which in my opinion looks pretty good you will see occasional you know little warpings here and there under the hood the game is still running at 30 FPS but it gives you that smoother 60fps look should you so [Music] desire all right and the actual last thing that I do is I have this weird fetish of combining modern stuff such as high resolution pgxp and lossless scaling with a retro CRT filter I think the combining of the two is really cool so just do this only if you want to this is a total subjective style thing but duck station has some built-in CRT filters and you could inject Reade if you want more options but I don't think it's really needed as duck station has some pretty good CRT filters built in already go to settings postprocessing click enable postprocessing now I already have my CRT filters set up um I use CRT lots and I have some adjustments here and I stack that with CRT guest HD I like to have the the kind of the barrel Distortion warping going on and uh this is just a cool way to add a little bit of a retro flare on top of it again if you don't want to do it then don't do it but I like it and that's it that is how I play Silent bomber and remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of moto the Father coim the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the comparison shots and enjoy the gameplay footage bye-bye [Music] [Music] [Laughter] I'll finish this guy off [Music] [Applause] you just signed your death

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfegbR8UWqU,youtube_transcript,xfegbR8UWqU,"behold how I play the game that everybody seems to hate Final Fantasy 7 durge of cbus I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that right but whatever in this video I will go over how to get the PC sx2 emulator my settings how to up the resolution how to increase the frame rate how to use HD textures and how to inject Reade effects should you so desire remember I am not claiming this is the best way to play nor the way you should play this is simply how I play take what you like disregard what you don't and also I do not claim to be the end all be all of emulation there most definitely will be choices and settings that you think are suboptimal so take it all with a grain of salt if you'd like to support the Channel please like And subscribe and hit the notification button on YouTube check out my link tree potentially join my patreon and check out my other social channels without further Ado let's get into it all righty then the first thing I'm going to do is go to pcsx 2.net looks like this grab the latest stable build or the latest nightly build I use nightly but it doesn't matter both will work for this particular game then I'm going to download it and extract it to a location of my choice the folder should look like this now before you click on it and start playing you are going to need a bios file I can't tell you where to get that but just search it it's not hard once you get it by default the emulator will be looking in documents pcsx2 bios and I don't have anything in here but that's where it will be default set the reason I don't have anything in here is I have mine set to a custom location if I go to system settings bios I have mine set to a custom location because I have a bunch of different versions of the emulator and I don't want to have a bunch of repeat bios files so I just point them all at the same place so either go to documents pcsx2 bios and place it in there or set a custom location inside the emulator once you do that go back to your pcsx2 folder and go down to pcsx2 dqt that's the one you're going to want to launch click on that it's going to launch and you won't see a bunch of games at first that's fine go to system settings game list place the directory of your game list click rescan all games and your games will show up click on durge of service I have a state let's load that and here we are running around playing my game now before we get playing there's a few things I want to fix there are some basic settings that for most games work but not always but for most so let's do those first I'm going to pause it I'm go to settings emulation I put the normal speed to 110% that puts me at 66 FPS the reason I do that this game has some slowdown and at 110% it keeps it at a solid 60 FPS and I can't hear any difference in the audio my e cycle rate I'm going to put at 300% for many games this improves frame rate and improves slowdown but not always I pretty much always have it checked occasionally it'll cause bugs with the game but the fast majority of games this does either nothing or it improves the per performance of the game I enable cheats because I like to play with cheats if I'm doing videos enable multi- threads if you have a multi-threaded CPU and I click optimal frame pacing sync to host refresh rate and use host vsync timing and vertical sync if I don't have a g-sync monitor these won't work if you go at 110% but I have a g-sync monitor if you don't have a g-sync monitor use vsync and leave that out 100% under Graphics rendering I put the blending accuracy to maximum this will uh emulate the PS2 frame buffer effects most accurately if your GPU can handle it put it at maximum if you have slowdown scale this back until you have a frame rate that you like and that's it for your basic settings now the next thing I'm going to do is I don't love the controls of this game they're a little bit wonky you don't have to remap this in the emulator the game itself has the ability press triangle go to config R2 over to controller setup and you can change the controls here the biggest thing is I changed my L2 and R2 to be the fire and magic button and I changed my shoulder buttons to be my reload and switch weapons and all that stuff for reference you can just see my setup [Music] here and now the game feels in place pretty good and I can roll around here and let's find some bad guys to shoot to test it out feeling good running pretty good frame rate's good let's go to the next [Music] step all right the first thing I'm going to do is adjust the resolution because the game's native resolution on a modern monitor is not going to look fantastic so I come over to settings Graphics rendering internal resolution I go all the way to 12x native which is 8k because my GP you can handle it and super sampling does improve aliasing just pick what balance of resolution and frame works for you oh looks like I died while that was happening that's okay we can reload and now I have 4K resolution that has super clean lines and I'm loving it the next thing we're going to do is I don't love the original aspect ratio and most PS2 games do have built-in widescreen patches on the newest version of pcsx2 it used to be difficult but now it's so much easier all you have to do is go to settings Graphics display aspect ratio change it to what you want fit windows screen and make sure that the widescreen hack is applied cuz if not it's going to stretch and there you go there is some minor stretching some games the patches are better than others but obviously adjust to your personal preference okay the next thing we're going to do is we are going to improve the textures if you look at this right here that texture is pretty blurry the ground's pretty blurry these old school textures don't look great on a modern screen to get the texture pack you can go to my gaming resource Bible in my link tree it'll be be in the bottom of the YouTube description and on my PS2 tab it's sorted by alphabetical order you can see durge of serverus click on that link that's going to take you to Ivy Rock's site who is the author of the texture pack unfortunately if you click get textures at the bottom download HD he now requires a $10 cost to get the texture pack when I first got this it was for free once that's done go to settings Graphics texture replacement and look where under here search directory where pcsx2 is telling you it's going to load or dump textures now you can change this to whatever you want but by default it's going to be in documents so then you're going to come over here documents pcsx2 textures and you're going to see the texture packs in here when you download the texture pack it has to be named the serial number of the game this particular game is SLS 21 419 sometimes there will be a second folder under here within the folder that has the same name it will not load so make sure that it says the correct serial number which you can also check if you don't know the serial number you can go to settings game properties and under serial you'll see the SLS number the serial number of the game so if you want the textures to load the folder has to match this particular number once that is done it's very simple go to settings Graphics texture replacement and click load textures and there we go textures are slightly sharper and have been replaced by upscaled versions of The Originals in enjoy those Saucy [Music] textures all right the next thing we're going to do is inject reshade for some effects go to reshade.me click download download reshade the newest version you don't need the add-on support once that's done you're going to launch it and then you're going to browse and you're going to go to wherever your pcsx to executable is and you're going to install it right here click next now on this section you have to pick what renderer you are using for pcsx2 to find out which one you're using go to settings go to graphics and right here I have Vulcan you can use directex or you can also use openg go it doesn't matter I prefer Vulcan for various reasons then I would just click Vulcan and I would hit next I have already installed rehad so I don't need to do this once you click next just check install all effects and then it'll take a few minutes and it will install then the next thing you going to do if you want to use depth based effects for lighting go go to Marty mods.com Buy on patreon you're going to go to his patreon it is $5 to get his effect batch but you can sign up for one month download it and then basically if you want I pay every month because he comes out with updates and I think his work is awesome that will give you access to his Discord you're going to want to go to downloads level one and snag the most recent version of a mer Pro for me at the time of recording is 2412 going to download that check it to my desktop then what you're going to do is wherever you installed your reshade to your pcsx2 executable you should see a folder that says reshade shaders if I extract this immerse Pro with wind RAR or whatever I'm using windzip inside of that you are going to see shaders and textures just grab the shaders from here and put them in your shaders folder and grab the textures and put them in there as well and you are all set up then we come over here we launch our game load my state you should see this bar up at the top saying that reshade is working I simply press home to bring up the reshade menu if it's your first time running it there'll be a thing that says start tutorial you can just click skip tutorial it's really not that big of a deal the first thing that you're going to do if you're going to use any depth based effects you want to search in here for Launchpad and enable that first and act at the top Launchpad has to be at the Top If you want to use any depth based effects now for this game I actually ended up not using any depth based effects because I didn't like the way they looked but I do want to show you how to set them up in case you do like the way it looks the next thing to be able to set up any depth B it's such a hard word to say any depth based effects is you have to click on display depth now initially you're probably going to see something like this click on add-ons this is going to go to your generic depth finder copy or check this box down here that has 3,900 something draw calls that's usually the right box to check after you check it you should see something like this now yours will probably look a little bit different cuz I've done a few adjustments under edit Global pre-processor definitions I change the top option to 4,000 and I press Z Z for the first one and zero for the third one this lets me know that the depth buffer is checking the geometry correctly on the left and it's checking the geomet or the depth excuse me correctly on the right darker things are closer lighter things are far away and looks pretty natural looks pretty good to me with that done I go AC at the top I turn off display depth if I want to use rtgi lighting I just type in rtgi it should be in there the mer Pro rtgi check on that now for this game I don't see much of a difference some games it doesn't do a lot I don't know why but you can use mxao which is like a form of ambient occlusion that will as you can see here bring in some lighting base on the screen the only reason I don't like it is now I can see the geometry in his cape being lit and it distracts from the illusion that the Cape is flowing and smooth so I don't use it however I do use DPX which increases the colors a little bit I use meteor andv sharpen which is a slight sharpening and I'll use vignette to kind of make this the sides around the edge a little bit darker looks a little more uh cinematic to me like that and that's pretty much all I do for this game when it comes to reshade and that's it that's my settings for this game if you want to see more in-depth gameplay footage I have another video settings showcase where I go over the comparison shots and extended gameplay footage of the first section of the game so you can see my settings that will be linked down below otherwise remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDDIBEdINAE,youtube_transcript,XDDIBEdINAE,"behold how I play The Legend of Zelda aquarena of time for this title I'm not using an emulator but I'm using the ship of harkinian unofficial PC Port that sounds confusing in this video I will go over how to get the PC Port how to set it up how to tweak your visuals including your resolution your Jitter your FPS uh different texture packs you can swap in and out and if you want even how to inject rtgi Ray Trace lighting because why not other things I'll go over are the controls how to set the game up to have like a free camera how to get your own sprint button and we'll go over cheats fixes randomizer and other various features of the PC Port now keep in mind this is how I play and my personal preferences aren't always going to align with yours so simply take what you like disregard what you don't so without further Ado let's go all righty then to get the ship of arini and PC report simply head over to ship ofar canon.com now you can click on setup guide that's going to take you to this page and show you and it has different guides for different platforms I'm using the windows guide which looks like this but it's quite simple click on the download on GitHub button that's going to take you to this page at the bottom of this page you're going to click on ship of harkinian Mac ready golf windows 64 zip when you download that it's going to be a zip file right click it and use your you know win raar or whatever windzip and extract that I already have it so I'm going to say yes to all now the next thing you're going to need is a legally acquired ROM but not all of the ROMs are compatible if you go to the setup guide and you click on ROM dumping guide that's going to take you to this page and at the bottom of this page number five it says validate your dumped ROM using one of our verification sites for ship of AR Kenyon use ship. equipment when you go to ship. equipment you'll see that the only ROMs that work with ship of Haron are the pal versions The 1.0 version 1.1 GameCube version and the mq version master quest version there's some debug versions that work as well what you're going to do is you're going to get your ROM legally from a legal Source you're going to take it in here put it in there it's going to tell you yes that works great so now we know that our ROM is working we take our ROM put it inside of the ship of harkinian folder then we click on ship of harkinian it's going to say no OTR files found generate one now it's going to look for that ROM file in the same folder and generate [Music] it no and here we go now the ship of AR kinon is working that's it it's that [Music] easy all righty then now that we got the ship of arini and running before we do some of the fun stuff such as the graphics and the texture options we need to get the controller working in the first place we need to change the control scheme to our personal preferences now my personal preferences again might not be yours so take it with a grain of salt this is just how I set up my controls and the last thing we need to fix is this UI menu if you press F1 to bring up the menu is incredibly small and very hard to read to fix that click settings go to graphics and come down to this image GUI menu scale I pick large now you might be tempted to pick extra large which is even easier to read but there's this red experimental in parentheses next to it because some of the menus if you go to extra large things will get cut off and you won't be able to adjust them unfortunately now the next thing that's going to happen is the game doesn't automatically detect my controller I don't want to play with the keyboard and mouse so go to settings controller controller mapping when're going to hit refresh it's going to be on auto I'm going to click Xbox One Elite 2 controller because that's what I'm playing with you pick your controller it's going to automatically map most of the buttons the way that you want but we're going to make a few tweaks that gets the game working I can run around I can play now the next thing that I'm going to do is I love the old school Z camera but I also want to play with a modern third person camera control scheme go to settings controller additional controller options and then under camera controls you want to enable free look now this is not going to work immediately because the game by default is going to map the C buttons to your right stick next you need to go to settings controller controller mapping we're going to take our C buttons and we're going to map them to our d-pad because aquar of time doesn't really use the d-pad so I'm going to go up down left right I'm going to map the C buttons to my d-pad and then my right stick I'm going to map to my camera up down left right and then the last thing that you're going to do depending on your preference is go to controller additional controller options under free look third person camera if you want to invert either either the x or the Y AIS you can do that and now we have a modern third person camera control scheme now the next thing that I'm going to do is I prefer more distance between the character and the camera go to settings controller additional controller options scroll down under Freel look on camera there's a tab called camera distance I'm going to make it 170 is where I like right here now again this is according to your personal preference now in terms of you I'm going to go to settings enhancements gaml reduce clutter I'm going to mute the low HP alarm because I think that's annoying I'm going to click minimal UI now minimal UI will not work immediately I do have to reload the screen and come back out so we're going to come in here we're going to go back out and now the UI is gone and the last controller thing that I prefer to do is give myself a sprint button go to settings controller Advanced controller options go to miscellaneous controls and then enable walk speed modifiers then under modifier 1 set it to 175% it will not work immediately you've got to map it then go to controller controller mapping I map the L button to the Z cuz I feel like the right trigger is better for Z targeting than the left trigger and then I map the L button to my modifier but that's actually in a different menu then I go to controller additional controller options Port One Xbox One Elite 2 controller modifier one I map to the left trigger so now when I press the left trigger I have 175% walk speed which is slightly faster than the roll I think the roll is 150% you can adjust it to whatever you like 175 feels natural to me and is quite convenient all right so the first thing we're going to do is adjust our resolution go to settings graphics and the first option will say internal resolution by default it's going to be set at 100% if you're looking at my screen and think wow that's a lot higher resolution than the original N64 game is because it obviously is don't quote me I think what's going on is that the PC Port sets 100% to match the resolution of your monitor it can go down as low as 50 and as high as 200% I set it at 150 because they have a beefy rig and super sampling is an expensive but really effective way of anti-aliasing based on the performance of your rig just adjust it to your preference next we are going to adjust the FPS of the game so go to settings graph graic I'm going to skip msaa because I'm already doing anti-aliasing with the resolution but you can adjust that if you want the next setting is FPS the original is 20 and 20 is not that bad the game was coded at around 20 if you want to leave it then leave it you can put it all the way to 30 60 anything all the 300 it's just banan crazy there's no need to do that I click match refresh rate which is going to match the refresh rate of your screen and give you the smoothest look possible now the game the other thing you want to do is fix the Jitter just match this to your FPS count that will get you a smooth FPS look if that is what you desire all right the next thing that we can do is we can swap textures as far as packs are concerned there's only two that I have tested and that is Ocarina of Time reloaded and Dip's 3DS experience I prefer Ocarina of Time reloaded however Dip's 3DS experience is also very very good and it has the added benefit of having improved pre-rendered back CRS the 3DS experience also has extra mods that I'm not going to be using but I want to make sure you guys are aware of and that is it brings in the 3DS models from the 3DS version of the game regardless of which pack you choose the installation is going to be the same for Aquaria time reload it if you want the 4K pack it comes in three zip files so I'm going to download all of those once that's downloaded extract it you're going to see a bunch of OTR files all you have to do is go to where your ship of harkinian executable is to the subfolder mods and place the OTR files in there if you're using Dip's 3DS pack you're going to see a lot more OTR files it's the same just put it in the mod subfolder then go back to your ship of hinan go to enhancements Graphics mods and check use alternate assets and boom we have all new 4k High defin textures Saucy all right the last thing that I like to do is inject rtgi Ray Trace lighting but I'm torn on this for three different reasons number one it requires a beefy GPU and I can't maintain 144 FPS while doing this number two some of the files are behind a patreon or patreon pay wall now you can pay for one month download of and unsubscribe it's only five bucks and number three as you can see here the lighting will highlight the geometry on models particularly link if you don't like the way that looks then this is probably not going to be worth it but if you do want to try it first thing that you're going to do is you're going to go to reshade and download reshade then you're going to go to Marty's mods.com click on Buy on patreon you're going to go to his patreon you're going to sign up for the $5 tier that's going to give you access to his Discord under Discord downloads level one download the newest version of aers Pro when that is all done you are going to install reshade you're going to browse and pick your ship of harini and execu cable you're going to hit next whatever you've picked on the ship of harkinian renderer you just got to match that you're going to hit next and install all the shaders I've already done that so we're not going to wait for it but that's all you do once that is done you take the immerse folder and you unzip it and you're going to see two folders inside shaders and textures just grab both of those and go to your ship of harini and executable after you've installed reshade there should be a folder that says reshade shaders just go to shaders grab your shaders grab all of these move them into there and then do the same thing for textures now it's going to get a little more difficult home is going to bring up your reshade menu you're going to search for Launchpad I already have it at the top you're going to click Launchpad that has to be running to do any of the rtgi r Trace lighting stuff the next thing you're going to do is search for display depth the left- hand side shows the models the right hand side shows the depth go to edit Global pre-processor definitions that's kind of hard to say and I'm going to change this first one Reet depth linearization fir plane to 75 by default it's going to be 1,000 now the difference you're going to see is the right side is all black black represents things that are close white represents things that are far away every game is a little bit different I have found that 75 to me looks the most natural the other thing that you're going to have to change is the Y pixel offset and I'll show you why I'm going to find my rtgi immers Pro rtgi you can just search it up here if you want when I click on that now I have the lighting but what you'll notice if I come down here and I take away this minus 2 now you're going to see that the lighting doesn't quite match with his model this slight offset so this will be different depending on your resolution so you're going to want to play with that ypel offset a little bit so that's it what that does is that now injects rtgi Ray Trace [Music] lighting now outside of that there are a bunch of things I'm not going to go over them individually cuz there's so many options but if you come up over under enhancements fixes there's a whole list of different like bug fixes and tiny little things I essentially check them all restoration is going to give you options to make things more like the original N64 game cheats you have infinite money Health ammo magic love opponent boost you have no clip there's also this thing called climb everything which I think is hilarious it totally breaks the game because you can climb everything the other one is hook shot everything once you get the hook shot you can hook shot to everything you can increase the hook shot reach you can increase the bomb timer you can have a bunch of other cheats oh yeah I Can't Forget About Time Savers under Time Savers here's a bunch of stuff I do do I turn the tech speed all the way up I turn King Zora speed all the way up I turned the forge time faster I turned the climb ladder speed faster because I had the sprint button and now when I climb a ladder I climb much faster ooh love it block pushing speed I put to four for faster heavy block lift and the rest of them are going to be based on what you like difficulty options you can do damage multipliers fall damage multipliers void damage multipliers Bonk damage multiplier you can spawn with full health no random drops and a bunch of other hyper bosses make the bosses faster the rest of it I advise just experimenting with and it's all going to be based on your personal preference but that's it this is how I personally am playing through the game right now other than that remember the good news of the gaming Goss spread the good word I say these things in the name of me and mother of the father coaching in the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the gaming"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eztgBP-K_1k,youtube_transcript,eztgBP-K_1k,behold the basic setup guide for pcsx2 in this video I'm going to show you how to set up the Playstation 2 emulator pcsx2 this video is not intended to be a comprehensive overview but rather to help you get up and running so you can follow along on any of my other game specific videos if you want a more detailed comprehensive tutorial I do have one on my patreon but I'll also be posting many of the tips and tricks on here over time if you just want to wait the first thing that we need to do is make sure we have a file archiver or compression tool [Music] this part's pretty easy you either need to download install 7zip or WinRAR 7zip can be found at 7-zip.com if you do get WinRAR it is going to try to get you to buy it you don't need to buy it you can do everything you need with the free trial and next to get the actual emulator itself [Music] next this is pretty easy to grab the emulator head to pcsx2 nnet you can download either the latest stable version or the latest nightly version either way download the version that is appropriate for your platform and after that you're going to need a bias [Music] file now I can't tell you where to get a bias file but it's really not hard you might just want to Google it but anyway once you have a bias file it's going to come in a zip folder then you're going to have your pcsx2 emulator also in a zip folder this is why we had a download our file archiver either one of these you're going to right click you're going to go down to that option and you want to ex check the option to extract it to its own folder so here I'm going to extract the PS2 emulator to a pcsx2 folder and now we see I have my pcsx2 folder here and I'm going to extract my BIOS file to a bios folder and now I have my P 2 bios all in here and my pcsx2 all in [Music] here all right next we're going to do the initial setup of pcsx2 open your pcsx2 folder and scroll down and double click the pcsx2 dqt now when you first boot it up you're not going to see any games that's because pcsx2 will probably be looking in the wrong place for your game you can see where it's looking by going to settings games list and under search directory it will tell you where it's looking for games to change that you can add a directory here and pick your folder or you can go to settings add game directory and do the same thing here now the next thing you have to do before you can play any games is get a bios file go to settings bios and it's going to tell you where pcsx2 is looking for the BIOS files by default it's going to be under documents I've changed it to a custom folder just for organizational purposes so you can see where to put it here and you can also pick a custom folder and place your your bios in there once that's done that is the basic setup and you're ready to start tinkering with your game [Music] settings all right before we can play a game we have to have a controller to control it go to settings controllers which will pop up this screen most of the time enabling sdl input source will work for most controllers but if you're using a dual shock controller check dual shock 4 and if you're using an older Xbox 3 Xbox One on Xbox series controller enable X input and if you're using a really old controller you're going to want to enable D input most of the time having sdl input source enabled is going to be good enough to configure your controller go down to controller Port one and this first option that says dual shock 2 this drop down gives you options to choose which type of controller you'd like to emulate you could pick the guitar you could pick the jogon the neocon but for 99.999% of games you're going to want to emulate the dual shock now if you're using a newer controller that's sdl you can just check automatic mapping and it's going to map it most likely correctly but if you want to map anything specific or game specific then you just click the up button here and I pressed up on my d-pad and if I see it switch that means my controller is detected and the mapping has been completed if I pick left and press left on my d-pad you'll see that come up and you can manually go through and pick each one and that's it before we play a game we might want to adjust the visuals so we'll get into graphic [Music] settings all right let's go over some basic Graphics settings to access this go to settings graphics and it will pop up this window the first thing we're going to look at is the renderer most people can just set this to automatic default this will just detect your video card and pick the correct one if you have a more modern video card and you want to get more into the weeds generally speaking I use Vulcan most of the time for most people just put automatic for the adapter pick defaults or you can pick your video card if you have multiple video cards full screen mode always borderless full screen aspect ratio for the most part you want to set it to fit to window full screen FMB aspect ratio override I leave off the interlacing automatic bilinear filtering I choose sharp if you switch it to smooth you'll notice that the image is a little bit blurrier or you can go to none and it's extra pixelated which won't really matter when we change the internal resolution so I think either of these work and then I almost always check apply widescreen patches if you set your aspect ratio to fit window full screen and the image seems stretched first check apply widescreen patches if that doesn't work check that the actual game options have a widescreen option for example God of War II has a native widescreen option so when I check apply widescreen patches nothing happens but the other 90% of game check this so that you don't have a stretched image the next tab we'll go over is the rendering tab the first option is internal resolution you can set your resolution to intervals of the Native Bas resolution if you want to go to around 1080p you want to do 3x native resolution and you can go all the way up to 12x for approximately 8K pick what your monitor supports plus what your GPU can handle now if you have a powerful GPU you can super sample I have a 4k monitor but I like to check it to 5K because I want to run the resolution slightly higher than my monitor supports which is often referred to as super sampling and can produce a slightly clearer image than traditional anti-aliasing methods the next thing you want to check is texture filtering almost all the time I leave this to PS2 trilinear filtering almost always leave to default anistropic filtering almost always put at 16x dithering I usually put at default but for this game I have it on scaled and blending accuracy this is very demanding of your GPU so basic or medium is what I generally recommend and then the last thing we could look at is texture replacement I'm not going to go over how to set this up I will cover texture packs in a separate video but this is where you can check load textures and the game will load custom textures and that is it for your basic graphic options the two most important things in my opinion are your internal resolution and your blending accuracy this is going to impact the image the most and it's also the two things that are going to impact the performance the most and with that now you can play a game but you also want to be able to save a game so we're going to get into setting up your memory [Music] cards all right to set up your memory cards it's pretty easy on this same menu go from Graphics to memory cards and under slot one you'll see a memory card loaded and under slot two now I already have some loaded but if you want to make new ones check create and you can pick from 8 megabytes which is considered the most compatible all the way to 32 I actually recommend 32 megabyte because as it says here most third party memory cards and it should work with most games and you can save more stuff so you're going to check 32 megabytes give it a name okay create that once that's done if you want to switch it to either of your slots you right click it and you can say use for slot one or use for slot two and that's it and the last thing I like to set up before I actually start playing a game is my hot keys [Music] all right to set up your hot Keys which will come in very useful go to settings surprise surprise go to hot keys and I'm just going to go over the ones that I have found to be the most useful pause I set to Space full screen I set it to alt return because that's standard for most other apps fast forward I set the tab and you can customize this speed and I'll get to that in my other more advanced setting videos and slow motion I set to caps lock the only other ones that I change for my personal taste my save state so save state is usually by default F1 and two but F1 and two often get used by other programs so if you're running anything on top of it like reshade or lossless scaling you can have some conflicting uh shortcut keys and it's easier to remember so I map my save to s for Save and I map my load to L for load and it's very easy to remember there's many many options in here and you can map all sorts of different things this is an area where everyone is going to have their own personal preference so it's most important that you're just aware that this hotkey section exists and that you can map things to your personal [Music] preference this should get the basics up and running so you can play almost any game on pcsx2 if you're interested in more advanced tips you can check out my patreon or my members only Discord or honestly you could just look up stuff on YouTube like texture replacement uh 60fps patches reshade injection so on and so forth plus I'm probably going to end up posting that stuff on my YouTube eventually anyway it's just that members get earlier access to it and remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of me and mother the father Co me the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the games
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky-BuWEnS2A,youtube_transcript,Ky-BuWEnS2A,"First, to snag ReShade, go to reshade.me. Click download the newest version. At the time of recording, it is 6.4.0 unless you're using a shader toggler. You do not need to get the add-on support version. Once it's downloaded, double click the .exe. It's going to bring you to this screen. Browse to the application you'd like to install it to. For this video, it's the PCSX2 emulator, which I will install to the PCSX2-QT. Once that's done, I'm going to hit next. On this screen, it will depend on which renderer you use when emulating. I almost always use Vulcan, so I'm going to check Vulcan. But if you're not sure, navigate to your PCSX2, click settings, graphics, and under renderer, it will tell you which one you're using. For most games and most reshade setups, it will not matter. You can use Vulcan, OpenGL, DirectX12, or DirectX1. As mentioned, I use Vulcan. So, I check Vulcan. Then, I hit next. On this screen, it's easier to install all of the effects. So, click uncheck all, then check all, which will enable all of the effects. Then, press next, and you're going to see a screen as it installs. Then, when it's installed, just click finish. Navigate back to your PCSX2 folder, and you should see a new folder called ReShade-shaders. Double click into that, and you'll see two folders, shaders and textures. If you install any other third-party shaders, take the shaders and place them in the shaders folder, and take the textures and place them in the textures folder. Once you are in your game, to open Reshade, press home, and you can start picking and choosing which plugins to use."

In this video, I'll go over remapping the gamepad for a modern control scheme, playing in widescreen, bumping up the resolution, reducing wobble with PGXP, injecting HD textures, and lastly, using lossless scaling for 60fps. Keep in mind, I'm not claiming this is the best way to play, but simply how I play. Take what you like, disregard what you don't.

Remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel, and you shall be blessed. I say these things in the name of me the Father, Kim, the Son, and Carmarmac, the Holy Ghost. Amen. And enjoy the video. [music] All right, the first thing I'm going to do before I upgrade the visuals is remap the controller so it plays like a modern FPS on a dual analog game pad. To do this, go to settings, game properties, and at the bottom under controller preset. I already have a Medal of Honor preset, but to make one, click edits, go to new preset, type in Medal of Honor, and hit okay. Then go down to controller port analog controller for port one. And it's pretty simple. Take the left and the right right stick and switch it to the left and the right for the left stick. Take it the left and the right left stick and switch it to the right. Then map the cross button to right trigger for fire. The circle button to left trigger for grenade. Then triangle and square. You can do whatever you'd like. Personal preference. You also can remap other stuff. I don't change anything, but again, it's up to your personal preference. Now, the game wasn't made for this control scheme. You can go to settings and you can adjust your analog dead zone and your analog sensitivity to your liking. and it will only apply to this game as long as you're using the preset Medal of Honor. And that's it. Now you can strafe around corners. You can look up and down while you move. And it does make the game significantly easier because enemies aren't really equipped to deal with you strafing. But yeah, I think it's worth it in my opinion. And that makes the game feel p. But we need to do some widescreen. [music] If [music] you're not a fan of playing in the original 4x3 aspect ratio and you want to play in the traditional 16x9, then simply go to settings, graphics, then under rendering, we're going to come down to the aspect ratio tab. It should say auto game native. Switch that to 16x9. You're going to notice that the image is fairly stretched. Come down to widescreen rendering. Check that. That's going to destretch the image and it will look like it plays in a traditional 16 by9. Now sometimes PS1 games you will see a little bit of geometry like you can see right here. It's actually behind me. Let me get out of the way. You see that there's a little bit of geometry that sometimes will not be rendered on the side of the screen because the game wasn't meant to be played in 16x9. It's pretty minimal in this game. And in fact, it is so minimal if you want to go even harder in the paint, you can actually come over here to 20x9. And you know what? The game actually looks pretty good in a 20x9 setup. You'll see a little bit more popping on the side, but honestly, I really, really like playing it in this aspect ratio, but I know a lot of other people don't. So, for the rest of the video, I will play it in a 16x9 aspect ratio. I wanted you guys to know that this is one of the few games on PS1 that you can get away with playing in 20x9 and have minimal geometry not being rendered on the sides of the game. And to me personally, this feels pretty grooving, but we can make it better by upping the [music] resolution. >> [music] >> If you play the game at its native resolution on a modern monitor, it's going to look extremely pixelated. You could use a CRT filter to capture the original look. But if you want a sharper, more modern presentation, go to settings, graphics, internal resolution, and select the interval that best matches your monitor's resolution. The result is a crisp, clean image. But at these higher resolutions, it's going to look extra wobbly. This is why we use PGXP. [music] Some areas of the game may look [music] more wobbly than you remember when you run it at a higher resolution. You can fix this using the PGXP options within the emulator. To enable it, go to settings, graphics, and turn on PGXP, but leave the depth buffer option unchecked. Then head to the PGXP tab and enable all the available options. The reason we avoid the depth buffer option is that while it can improve certain visuals, it also introduces weird clipping issues on the Z-axis for this game and many others. This alone makes the game look noticeably more stable. But we can take it even further with [music] some HD textures. [music] [music] The HD texture pack featured here was created by Blackhand. While he usually keeps his packs behind a Patreon payw wall, he does open them up for free almost every weekend. Once you've downloaded the pack, extract it. Then open the Medal of Honor folder. Inside, you'll find a folder labeled Sluss0000974. Take that folder and place it into documents, duckstation textures. Next, head to settings, graphics, textures, and simply enable load textures. Now, we've got HD upscale textures. However, because the PS1 textures start from such a low base resolution, you will notice a bit of AI wonkiness here and there, but in motion, I do think overall it is a step up visually and worth it. With this, the game is looking close to its best, but we can push it further with 60fps. [music] [music] Lossless scaling is a free frame generation and resolution scaling tool you can grab on GitHub or Steam. First, in your emulator, go to settings, graphics advance, and make sure exclusive full screen is set to borderless full screen. Otherwise, loss of scaling will not work. Next, open loss of scaling. Under type, select the newest version of LSFG. Set the mode to adaptive. Set target to match the refresh rate of your monitor. Hit scale and then tab back to your game. Now, loss of scaling will interpolate the frames and target the frame rate you selected. You'll notice some artifacts here and there, but since the base game runs at a steady 30 fps, loss of scaling does a pretty good job. Video platforms generally don't support more than 60 fps, so it's hard to properly show you in this recording, but trust me when I say seeing an old PS1 title running at a quasi 144 fps on a high refresh rate monitor is such a cool mix of retro and modern. And that's it. That's the best I got. And enjoy the comparison shots. [music] [music] >> [music] [music] >> Heat. Heat. [music] >> [music] [music]"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKV-phyaLFI,youtube_transcript,eKV-phyaLFI,"Behold, how to remaster Devil May Cry 3 for free. In this video, I'll be going over my favorite ways to play DMC 3, which include emulation via PCSX2 and modding the PC version of the HD collection. Now, I choose to not even bother with the 2006 PC port due to poor optimization, no controller support, and weird things like having to uninstall and reinstall the game simply to change the text language. This all can be fixed with mods, but the HD collection doesn't require these fixes in the first place, and the best mods are not compatible with the 2006 version. As such, I don't see a reason to bother with the 2006 port. But it is an interesting title, as it's one of three games in existence where Ubisoft handled distribution for Capcom on PC. The other two being Oniima 3 and Resident Evil 4. It's weird seeing an Ubisoft and Capcom logo on a box art. Anyway, I'm not claiming the following ways are the best ways to play, nor the only ways to play, but rather simply how I've been playing. Take it all with a healthy grain of salt. If you want to support my work, hit like, subscribe, and smash the notification bell. Share the good news of the gaming gospel, and ye shall be blessed. I say these things in the name of me, the Father, Coach the Son, and Carmarmac, the Holy Ghost. And without further ado, let's look into emulating on PCSX2. [Music] If you are completely new to PCSX2, check out my basics guide linked below to get started. First, I head to settings, graphics, and change the aspect ratio to widescreen and enable apply widescreen patches, which will reduce the amount of stretching on the image. After that, the game's default resolution on a modern monitor is quite pixelated. So, I head to settings, graphics rendering, and choose the resolution I'd like. Personally, I overshoot my 4K monitor for a bit of super sampling. Deinlacing will be set to automatic, and for this game, it causes this weird subtle banding issue. I played with all the settings, and the best one to my eye is blend top field first, which will clear the image up a bit more. However, to be frank, this will still be blurry compared to playing on PC. Lastly, I set the blending accuracy to medium, which may seem whack, but it's because of the following texture [Music] packs. Now, for a quick tutorial on the basics of using texture packs, first you have to know where to place the packs. So, go to settings, graphics, and under texture replacement, you will see under search directory the folder where PCSX2 is going to be looking for textures. By default, it's going to be users, documents, PCSX2, textures. You can also place a custom folder here if you want to organize it differently. Now, in your textures folder, you want to place the texture packs with the serial number of the game you're running. To find out which version of the game you're running and what serial number to name it, boot your game, and then go to settings, game properties, and you will see under serial the serial number of the game that you are running. You want to make sure that the serial number matches the game that you're running texture packs with. And if you have multiple texture packs, I just rename them in parenthesis so I can switch between them fairly easy. Once that's all done, to load the textures, go to settings, graphics, texture replacement, and check load textures. And you should see the textures all load. Now, for most games, you're also going to want to check asynchronous texture loading and pre-cache textures. And that's it. I tested three packs for this game. Blackhands, CC Chrysalids, and Leon S. Kennedys. Now, the first two are both an AI upscale of the native textures. If you want to keep the original look of the game, I would recommend either of these packs. Now, the third pack by Leon S. Kennedy is dramatically different. Most of the textures appear to be created manually as they are often completely different than the original textures. For example, here in the club, the wall textures and railing are very different compared to the original game. Personally, I like it. I think the original look of this room was a bit messy. This is also the reason why we earlier set blending accuracy to medium. For some reason, if it's set any higher with this particular pack, you will experience weird visual glitches and color banding. Overall, I think this setup looks pretty badass. But let's touch it up with some shader glass. [Music] Shader Glass is a program that lets you use reshade type filters as a transparent window over anything on your computer. It also has my favorite CRT shaders that were previously only compatible with the Retro Arc front end. Behold the Retro Crisis CRT packs. To use Shader Glass, also snag it from the link below and click on shader. Choose from library and navigate to Retro Crisis 4K curved and I prefer PS2 clean. Now you have modern resolution and HD textures, but a bit of retro thrown into the mix. Shader class plus the Leon S. Kennedy textures is my preferred way to emulate this title. But there are some things that are not so great when you [Music] emulate. Some of the downsides of emulating the PS2 version is if you have a high refresh rate monitor, aside from lossless scaling interpolation, there is no way to get above 60 fps without speeding the game up. If you combine lossless scaling with any of the CRT filters, it messes with the interpolation. Also, shadow quality is inferior to the PC version, and the overall picture, as mentioned before, is not as sharp. However, emulating in general is pretty plugandplay once you've done it a few times. I do ultimately think the PC version with mods is the superior way to play, but it comes at the cost of increased setup time and potential troubleshooting. If you want to see, let's get into modding on [Music] PC. As mentioned in the intro, I didn't bother at all with the 2006 port. I recommend snagging the HD collection because it basically runs right out of the box minus one feature. It doesn't support 4K resolution in the native options menu. To fix this, go to program files, Steam, user data, your user number 631510, remote, and open options.save. Then edit your width and height to 3840x 2160 or your preferred resolution. If you don't care about any other enhancements, this is the easiest way to play in 4K. It's a sharper image compared to PCSX2. Plus, you get all the extra stuff in the HD collection. However, if you want enhanced gameplay options, upgraded textures, 120 FPS, or to inject RTGI ray trace lighting, you've got to get into [Music] modding. Originally, I was going to do a big complicated tutorial combining multiple mods and a bunch of small fixes for each one. I had tracked down dead links, found missing files, fixed broken textures, all from researching across multiple forums. It took me ages. But in between that time and now when I started editing this video, there are a bunch of new mods. One in particular by author Nevin's mods is everything I had previously figured out, every fix and every tweaked texture, but packaged all up in one simple mod with three easy steps. So, but also it's [ __ ] awesome. His mod titled Pepo DMC HD Collection Revision 2 combines three main mods. First, it has the abandoned HD texture pack by Pepo. This pack is a combination of original textures and DMC4 textures, which changes the look quite a bit, but I like it. It also combines cutscene Dante and cutscene Virgil texture packs. And lastly, it contains, in my opinion, the absolutely essential DDMK style switcher mod by Serpentine, if I'm saying that right, which is a comprehensive overhaul mod with tons of features, including 120 FPS. But the star of the show is you can now switch styles on the fly, opening the game up to absolutely insane combos that were never possible before. This 3in-1 pack is only missing one thing I would like, which is injecting rayraced RTGI lighting. However, there is one slight problem. I cannot get the HD textures and RTGI lighting to work together. It is beyond my power. Profound sadness. Sad. In theory, I know it's possible. The issue is the HD texture mod uses Special K, which inherently has conflicts with ReShade. However, Special K has official functionality to use ReShade as a third-p partyy plugin. But this is a custom version of Special K tweaked by the author and eventually I did get ReShade working and at the last minute on step 9.5 out of 10. I was so excited. RTGI would fail to compile me again. I went to the RTGI forums and asked for help. Started over from scratch multiple times and honestly I just ended up giving up. At this point, my feeble, scourged, unworthy, god-cursed piece of self had to make a choice. HD textures or RTGI lighting. I'll show you both. If you want to use the HD textures, then the following explanation shall be my [Music] pleasure. As mentioned, you will want to snag the mod Pepo DMC HD Collection Revision 2. The instructions are honestly really easy. You download the zip files linked in the mod description and paste them into the folders instructed. Two disclaimers though. Number one, this will also install the style switcher mod. And whether you're going to use anything in it or not, if it's installed, you do need to enable the actor option before each mission to prevent crashes. Number two, the author did add some NSFW backgrounds to this pack. If you'd like to delete that, go to Steam Steam DMC3 where your executable is. Then go to SKR res, inject textures, DMC3, artwork, menus, and delete the ones that are too spicy to show here. This is my favorite texture pack of the total four that I tested. It does change the look of the game, but not nearly as drastically as the Leon S. Kennedy pack for PS2. But if these textures don't catch your eye, then let's try some RTGI. [Music] If you don't want to mess with the HD textures and you rather have some saucy RTGI ray trace lighting, then you're going to want to download Reshade, install it to the DMC3 executable, and choose DirectX 10, 11, or 12, which I don't know why this works. The game's PC wiki says it's DirectX9. RTGI shouldn't even work with DirectX9, but it does. I'm not complaining. Once that's done, you'll need to join Marty McFly's Patreon to get access to his Discord. You can join for one month and immediately cancel if you want. However, I choose to support him monthly. Go to download level one. Snag the most recent version of immerse. Then go to your DMC3 executable and you will see a folder named reshade shaders. Copy the contents of the immerse folder over and overwrite identical files. While in game, press home to bring up the reshade menu. Search for an effect called launchpad and enable it. Then search for display depth. Go to add-ons. Click one of the two frame buffers for detection. Go back and down to edit global pre-processor definitions. Change the option for depth input is reversed to one. Then change the linear plane value to around 4,000. Then search for RTGI and enable it. For your information, you can also tweak this by increasing or decreasing the amount of rays and how many steps they bounce to optimize the frame rate for your specific PC build. There's also a bunch of other reshade options you can tinker with as well based on your preference. I like to use ambient occlusion, various color correction, and level adjustments. Now, the last option to make the game extra blessed is [Music] 120fps. If you are running the HD textures, the DDMK style switcher mod will already be installed. If you're running RTGI lighting, head over to Nexus Mods with the link below and follow the instructions to install the style switcher mod. It's just copying some files over. Once you are in game, press Ctrl + D and that will bring up the style switcher menu. Now, there is so much you can do with this mod. However, this video is not an overview of the entire mod, but rather how to use it to achieve 120 FPS. For 120 FPS, use control D to bring up the style switcher menu. Go to speed and set the main game to.5 or half. Then go to system and set the frame rate to 120. If you have a free sync or G-Sync monitor, force VSYNC off or leave it on auto. Most platforms do not support 120 fps video, so you're not going to see the difference here. But I can assure you, if you have a high refresh rate monitor, this is well, well worth it. Seeing Dante in action at 120 fps is glorious, and I desire all to receive [Music] it. Since recording and editing this video and discovering the HD texture 3in-1 mod, there was another mod that just launched a couple days ago at the time of recording called the DMC3 Crimson Mod. This has everything the style switcher mod has, plus much more. It adds tons of gameplay tweaks mimicking features found in Devil May Cry 4 and 5, traditional thirdp person camera control mods, a really to easy use UI, and it even has local co-op. Yes, you can slay demons as Dante and Virgil with your homie on the couch. I have started tinkering with this mod and it's awesome, but I haven't had time yet to see what's compatible with it visually. However, I feel comfortable saying in terms of raw gameplay, this is the definitive way to play. [Music] If you wanted to play the original game and still have some options to improve the visuals, then I would say emulate on PCSX 2 and potentially use a texture pack of your choice. If you'd like a new, fresh, and just better way to play, then I would simply snag the Crimson Mod and call it a day. If you want to make it as pretty as possible, I'd say use the revision to mod pack and 120 fps. And lastly, if you just think RTGi lighting looks really cool, then just use that. The ultimate would be to combine all three and I think it's possible and I will try again but I'll have to save that for another day. Until then share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed. I say these things in the name of me and mother the son and Carmarmac the Holy Ghost. Amen. And enjoy the comparison [Music] shots. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music]"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV-yb2WMrQk,youtube_transcript,ZV-yb2WMrQk,behold my attempt to use the Dark Side of emulation to remaster fan favorite Oni Musha 3 demon si in this video I'll be going over how to get the pcsx2 emulator my settings for 4K 60fps how to use an HD texture pack and my personal reshade settings plus if you want 12 FPS how to use lossless scaling to achieve that remember I am not claiming this is the ultimate or best way to play this is simply how I play so take it all with a healthy grain of salt if you'd like to support the Channel please remember to like subscribe and hit the notification button remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of me and mother the father coaching me the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the [Music] video all righty then the first thing we're going to do is head over to pcsx2 nnet I like to grab the latest nightly build you can grab the latest stable doesn't really matter for this game once that is done you're going to extract it to the location of choice and this is what you're going to see you want to boot up the PC SX 2-qt version that has the gooey but before you do that you are going to need a bios file which is usually found in documents pcsx2 bios that's the default setting however you don't see anything in mine because I have mine set to a custom folder which if you'd like to do go to settings bios and then right here on under pcsx2 will search for bios images in this directory I have mine set to a custom folder because I have a bunch of different versions of pcsx2 and I don't want to have repeat bios files so I just point them out of the same spot so either I can't tell you where to go get the BIOS file but it's not hard just Google it either put it in the default settings which is documents pcsx2 bios or create a custom folder here under settings bios browse it and place them there once that's done boot up the pcsx2 dqt you'll see something like this if this is your first time you will not see any games to set your games go to settings games list and put the folder where your you want to place your games and hit rescan all games and you will see the list of games I'm going to boot up uni Musha 3 demon Siege and here's the game running at Native resolution and Native aspect ratio which is going to look extremely pixelated on a modern screen particularly if you have a 4k monitor like mine before we get into the graphics there's a few settings that I Chang I go to settings emulation I set the normal speed either to 110 or 120% this gives me a few extra frames and makes the game feel snappier and it only changes the audio ever so slightly if at all if that bothers you just set it to 100% it also allows for smoother lossless scaling in the future if you want to do that for this game I don't set the the cycle rate to 300% I normally do that for most PS2 games it doesn't seem to do anything and I noticed some weird wonky timing stuff so for e I set it to normal speed and I set optimal frame pacing and sync to host refresh rate and I don't check vertical sync because I have a g-sync monitor if you don't have a g-sync monitor you might want to check vertical sync and that gets me running at around 70 frames a second the game feels Snappy and we're ready to move on and fix the graphics so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to settings Graphics under rendering I'm going to change internal resolution I go all the way up to 8X to 5K now this is for two reasons one if I do what is called super sampling which is Run the game at a higher resolution than my monitor which is a traditional 4K 3840 X 2160 that is an expensive version of anti-aliasing it makes the image a little bit smoother the second reason is if I check the 4K setting the actual resolution is 3872 by 2688 there are different base resolutions that is why the pcsx2 emulator labels this as approximately 2160 or 4K because it depends on the base resolution of the game so I like to overshoot just a little bit because my GPU can handle it and super sampling gives me a slightly Sharper Image so I pick 5K now the next thing you're going to notice is the game is a little bit wobbly still for some PS2 games you're going to have to click apply no interlacing patches once I click that then the game is appearing much much smoother the next thing that I'm going to want to do is get widescreen working the newest version of pcsx2 is going to by default apply wide wi screen patches you used to have to manually get them you don't have to anymore they're essentially all built into pcsx2 so you just come over to aspect ratio and I set fit to window full screen it is going to stretch it a little bit but the wide screen patch is going to keep it from being stretched too much if you don't like the stretching then just play it at Native and that is it for my basic pcsx2 settings my wide screen and my resolution now we're going to move on to Saucy HD textures [Music] okay to get HD textures simply go to onhd rp. comom have to shout out Martin s and mad 58 for their work both on Oni Musha 2 Oni Musha 3 and Oni Musha dawn of Dreams click on oni3 that will take you to the oni3 sub page and simply click either the Dropbox or G Drive link to download the textures I also want to mention there are extra textures should you want to use them there's a ninja costumes different Oni costumes sooki costume tenai costume juet costume so on and so forth now the texture folder should come named the right serial number but just so you know how to double check that and how to get it we go to settings game properties and it's going to tell you the version of demon siege that you're playing for this version It's SL 2694 then click settings Graphics texture replacement and under search directory you're going to to see where pcsx2 is going to be looking for your textures by default it's set to user documents pcsx2 textures you can change it to a custom folder if You' like once it's downloaded I extract it and put it in my documents pcsx2 textures folder here we see it it says SL 20694 double click it and make sure that it says dumps and Replacements sometimes texture packs will be packaged with a folder under the SL folder that's the repeat so you'll click it it'll say SL 2694 and you click it and it'll say SL 2694 again if that's the case pcsx2 will not read it so you'll have to extract everything out and make sure that there's not a repeat folder it won't happen with this one but it does happen with other packs and it can be a huge time waster trying to figure out why the pack is not loading so learn for me and my dumb mistakes once that's done go back to your texture replacement tab under graphics and simply click load textures and bada beinging bada boom you can click load and unload to see the difference also make sure asynchron texture loading and pre-cast textures are set this will make things a little bit smoother once that's done you can simply check and uncheck load textures to see the difference and in many screens it's going to be quite drastic and that's it now you are playing with 4K upscaled HD textures the game looks just a little bit better and we are going to move on to [Music] reshade to snap reshade go to reshade.me click download that's going to take you to this page at the time of recording download the newest version which is 6.3.3 double click the exe it's going to bring up this window asking where you'd like to install it to click browse navigate to where your pcsx2 emulator is and click pcsx2 dqt then click next now depending on which renderer you're using will decide what you choose here to check that go back to pcsx2 go to settings graphics and check the renderer I'm almost always using Vulcan so I'm going to check Vulcan and then when I hit next It'll ask me which plugins I want to do I'll simply check all of them I'm not going to do it cuz it's already installed but once you hit next it'll take a few minutes let it install once it's installed boot your game back up and hit the home key the home key is going to bring up your reshade menu if it's your first time using reshade there'll be a tutorial popup just click skip tutorial and now we can start picking what we want there are so many things here and it's all very subjective so I'm just going to show you what I like for this particular game take it all the grain of salt and experiment to see what you like I use levels which crushes the blacks and increases the contrast a little bit DPX increases the brightness I used AMD Fidelity contrast adaptive sharpening and last but not least for this particular game I like the CRT filter CRT fake lots and I have artificially increased the scan line weight down here in options ever so slightly to keep everything organized hit active to top and that's going to put all the active plugins up here to easily turn on and off I like the whites to be just a little bit blown out a little bit overblown it reminds me of a CRT TV I had as a kid it has Nostalgia for me again for the third time I know I'm beating a dead horse this is very very subjective just go through an experiment it's really fun to experiment and figure out what you like bik and the last thing we're going to do is if you have a high refresh Monitor and a g-sync monitor let's get the game running at 120 FPS for that super smooth [Music] look all right we're going to go to steam and we're going to purchase lossless scaling which I think it's only six bucks we're going to hit launch we're going to set the frame generation to whatever the newest model is at the time of recording it's 3.0 I'm only going to put X2 then I'm going to tab over to my Oni Musha in order for this to work at least for me the game has to be set in windowed mode not exclusive full screen or lless scaling will not detect it and I'm going to go back to lless scaling I'm going to hit scale tap back to my game and I'm going to wait there's going to be a little Flash and now the game is running at 144 frames a second you're not really going to see it because you uh for some reason you even when I upload videos with 120 FPS to YouTube it just compresses them to 60 frames a second and I've seen other creators have 120 FPS videos so if anyone knows how to get YouTube to accept that um let me know so you guys are not going to see a difference because it's going to be uploaded in 60 frames a second but you'll see some uh numbers on the top left corner of the screen what the input FPS is and then what the output FPS is and the game looks extremely smooth that's it that's my attempt to remaster Oni Musha 3 demon Siege let me know how much you hate it in the comment section below all engagement is good engagement right remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of M the father Co the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the comparison shots [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArstSQv0BVM,youtube_transcript,ArstSQv0BVM,"behold my quest to find the best way to play the 1998 rage software's CT classic incoming this game was requested by faithful patreon member Beats by Kev thank you very much may the gods bless you in this video I'll go over how to get the PC version working on a modern rig and compare that with emulating the Dreamcast version on flycast or redream I'll go over the pros and cons of each approach and give my final conclusion at the end of the video now keep in mind I'm not claiming this is the ultimate best

Channel please click like subscribe and hit the notification button remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of me and mot the Father coim the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the video [Music] all right first thing we're going to do is we're going to head over to steam you can grab incoming forces which is the sequel that comes bundled with the first game as well or you can head over to Gog it's also three bucks on Gog as well again that is both incoming and incoming forces the SQL which I heard is not very good I'm not going to mess with incoming forces but they come together in a bundle now when you first boot up the game if it works without any bugs which we'll get into the bugs in a second it's going to look like like this it's going to have 4.3 aspect ratio and there's going to be no options to change the resolution you're also going to probably run into some bugs I'm going to include this Steam Community Post in the description of the YouTube video if you run across any of these problems like errors please report exception code etc etc create surface for zbuffer failed errors there is instructions for all these and how to fix this in this community thread I did not personally run into any of these but reading the comments they seem to be fairly common what I did run into is that you cannot change the resolution of the game now you can force it by going to the properties in Steam so if I come over to my library go to incoming forces and I go manage or go to properties and if I hit till the screen mode that will give you some resolution options when you boot the game it's going to look like this however that resolution is going to max out at 1024 by 768 which is really not that high if you have a modern monitor 1080P or above I have a 4k monitor that's not going to work for me and once you get the game running even at that resolution you're going to notice there are missing textures on lots of stuff and this is just like oh wonderful well the good news is we can fix missing textures and get modern resolutions with the next step I'm going to go back to this community thread and I'm going to go to the next step which is download DG voodoo from the website so I'm going to go to this site I'll put the link in the YouTube description ion I'm going to download DG Voodoo 2.84 point1 then I'm going to extract that from the zip file it's going to look like this you're going to have all of this stuff all I need to do is pull all of this stuff put it into the same file with my incoming exe so for me that's steam apps common incoming plus incoming forces into incoming then I'm going to drag the MS x86 I'm going to drag all of this stuff as well and pull it into here and you're going to see that it's here D3 d8 D3 D9 all those once that is all in there I'm going to rightclick DG Voodoo and run as an administrator if you don't do this it will not save your settings now this took me some time to figure out and it is it's all in the steam guide here actually read all of this stuff I skipped this thinking that I could figure that on my own and it caused me some problems so this is what you have to have to have to do you have to use direct X and you have to set your video card to the ATI Radeon 8500 or your going to have UI issues once I pick ATI Radeon 8500 I'm going to set my vram as high as possible any sort of modern video cards going to at least have 256 megabytes I'm going to set my resolution to my screen resolution I turn vsync off because I have a g-sync monitor if you don't have a g-sync monitor you're going to want to click Force vsync put the apply Fong shading when possible I place that I do not do any anti-aliasing because 4K is pretty high resolution already and some of the reshade effects I will do later will get broken if msaa is on if you're not going to use any reshade effects and you can turn this on for a slightly smoother image and then I'm going to set my Force anistropic to 16x that's pretty standard mini mapping autogen with bilinear filter and then under General I make sure I pick my video card my display and output B API dis leave as best available one you hit apply for all of these things then I simply come over here and I boot up my game now the game is running in full 4K resolution and 60 frames a second now when you first boot it up it's going to be kind of chuggy I don't know why this happens but as soon as I move the cursor the game goes a little bit faster now if it's going extra extra fast go to game options video and turn frame scaling on if frame scaling is off it's going to uncap the frame rate which is good in theory but the game is super super fast and unplayable so you don't want to do that once that's all done I can start playing the game start game let's just do arcade Pi my ship and you'll notice there is no more missing textures and now we're running the game in proper WID screen 60fps and at a modern resolution it's pretty good but we can give it a little extra sauce with our good friends over at reshade I'm going to head over to reshade I'm going to download reshade at the time of recording the newest version is 6.3.3 I'm going to download that then I'm going to click setup I'm going to come over here I'm going to go to browse I'm going to navigate to where my my incoming exe is which for me is steam steam apps common incoming incoming click this next I'm going to pick Microsoft direct X cuz that's what the G the DG Voodoo plugin is going to be using then I'm going to hit next and choose all of the plugins I already did it so I'm not going to do it right now you'll see some plugins get installed once that's done in your incoming folder you should see this folder now reshade shaders I want to use some depth based stuff like rtgi lighting so I'm going to head over to mods.com click on Buy on patreon I'm going to join his patreon for five bucks I pay every month but if you want to just pay five bucks download the plugins and then cancel you can do that I like to support him up to you do whatever you want once I have access to his Discord I'm going to go to downloads level one I'm going to download the newest version of aers Pro at the time of recording that's 2412 once that's done I'm going to extract that I'm going to open the folder and there's going to I'm going to see two folders shaders and textures I'm going to open shaders grab everything thing copy it and paste it into my shaders folder in my incoming directory and then I'm also going to grab all the textures grab all of those copy them and put them in the textures folder and click if I do that you're going to see replace replace all the files in the replace all the files in the destination now that reshade is installed I'm going to come back to my incoming double click it you should see up here on the top left reshade if it's working it will show I'm going to hit start game arcade once I'm I'm playing I'm going to hit the home button which opens my reshade menu the first thing I'm going to do is enable immerse Launchpad that has to be at the top then I'm going to enable display depth which is going to show you the left and the right of the depth I had to make a couple changes so to get the depth correctly your msaa has to be turned off or it won't work you're going to click on add-ons and then check this button right here with your 70 draw calls that's going to show your display depth and you're going to see all black in the beginning because you have to set how far the plane is it's going to default to a th000 right here so if I go back to 1,000 you're going to see all black on the right hand side of the screen that means there really is no depth every game's a little bit different I found for me the most natural depth is 50 and things that are farther away are lighter and things that are closer are darker so we see the ship is dark black and then we see some gray out here some middle gray and some white for the depth once that's done I turn off display depth then I turn on my RTG lighting which you're going to see a noticeable change here it is off here it is on so the ground is going to inherit the lighting color of the sky and then I'm also I like to turn on immersed sharpen which sharpens just a little bit I like to turn on Bloom it's a little heavy we'll adjust that in just a second god Ra an ssdo and that is it if you want to change the bloom strength I'm going to come down here I'm going to find my Bloom I'm going to do ey before I can do this and I'm going to change my overall intensity to a little bit lower So based on how much Bloom I want I'm going to change the intensity to right about here and now I'm playing with RTG i r Trace lighting you can see the lighting effect the ground you can see it's not as strong in some other games but you'll see explosions on the ground and certain things pop just a little bit more so this is pretty much the best I could get it looking on PC the only thing I don't like is there's I couldn't get any controller support to work out of the box there are some mods and things you could do to get a game pad working some thirdparty applications but if you want to use a game pad or do less work to get it working I would recommend emulating the Dreamcast version which we will get into [Music] next all righty then the first thing we have to decide when emulating the Dreamcast version is which Dreamcast emulator to use you have two options you have flycast which is here on GitHub and you also have redream at redream doio normally for most games I would recommend flycast it's graphic user interface or goei is not as good and it's not as easy as a setup but it has more options so when I boot up flycast I boot up my game and I can immediately start playing which is nice plug-and playay but there's a couple things you'll notice with the flycast version number one down here on the left it only runs at 30 frames a second and I don't know why it runs at 30 frames a second because I'll show in just a minute when you emulate the game on redream it defaults at 60 frames a second now with flycast you have more options with settings I can come into my settings I can do Shadows fog widecreen super widecreen widescreen game cheats like a widescreen hack for a PS1 emulator I can force vsync I can show my FPS I can go to really high resolutions this is uh 7,000 by 4,000 I can change my per pixel settings I can do texture upscaling I can load custom textures that's the big thing that I I almost always recommend flycast if a Dreamcast game has a texture pack well then you can use flycast to swap those textures out this game however does not have a texture pack so there's uh nothing to be done here so this is what the game looks like maxed out with texture upscaling and it runs at 30 frames a second and then you'll see on the left and the right here the widescreen r ring has some issues there's also other effects which I may or may not capture on camera right now such as flashes from explosions that will not render at widescreen and looks very very weird so the widescreen cheats or the hack for this game doesn't work very well on flycast let's compare that with redream redream has less options but it's much more plug-and playay you simply come over to video mode you can change your window mode I set my full screen resolution to 4K 16x9 change my frame rate counter to V blanks and I turn vertical sync off because I have a gsync monitor and if you do not have a g-sync monitor then you're going to want to turn vsync on and I set polygon sort accuracy to per pixel 64 layers which is the highest quality then I come over to games I hit incoming and immediately you're going to notice in the top left the game is running at 60 frames a second which is interesting it doesn't run at 60 frames a seconds on flycast and I don't know why to be honest so when you boot up redream that's all it takes you immediately get 4k 60 FPS and you get Gamepad support which I I feel like the game controls so much better with the GamePad the only downside to this version is the wide screen you'll notice is the image is slightly stretched but on redream all the effects and everything render properly in widecreen and the most important thing that I like about this is it takes almost no work to get set up you just download the redream emulator set your resolution in your wide screen and then boot up the game and you're going it's quite literally like 80% less work than getting the PC version up been [Music] running so my final thoughts are if you are a purist and you want to play the PC version with keyboard and mouse and you want to have rtgi ra Trace lighting and you're willing to do the work to get the resolution fixed and the missing textures fixed and install DG Voodoo and reshade and all that stuff if that doesn't sound like too much work then play the PC version but otherwise if you just want to try this game out and play in 4k 60 and have a Gamepad work right out of the box and just plug and play I think just emulating this on redream is honestly the way that I would recommend because the differences in visuals between this emulating the Dreamcast version with redream and then doing all the work to get the PC version up and running it's very very minuscule differences and you don't have Gamepad support if you want to play the game pad so I lean moderately in the direction of recommending emulating the Dreamcast version with redream with the caveat that there are some differences with the Dreamcast port and if you're a purist and you don't mind the extra setup work then the PC option would be my next recommendation thanks again to Beats by Kev for the recommendation this game is awesome I will be playing more of it until then remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed to say these things in the name of me m the Father coim the Son and karmac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the games"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUcAsShb0gk,youtube_transcript,oUcAsShb0gk,behold how I played the PS1 cult survival horror classic Dino Crisis in this video I'll go over how to get duck station how to do the basic configurations how to up the resolution how to make it widescreen how to fix the PS1 warble how to install HD textures and lastly how to use lossless scaling to get a smoother 60fps look now I chose the PS1 version for a couple of reasons number one I just wanted to see what I could do with the original PS1 version but number two there is a Dreamcast version with HD textures and a PC version I didn't choose the Dreamcast version because it does have some texture warable and there's no option to fix that in the Dreamcast emulator the PC version with Source Forge or Source net I think it's called can be a bit of a hassle to setup depending on your PC if you'd like to see a breakdown comparing the three different versions a channel I subscribe to that's awesome I highly recommend is entertainment extended they a fantastic breakdown between the three different versions however at the time of recording there was no duck station texture support or an HD texture pack for the PS1 version remember I'm not claiming this is the best way to play nor the way that you should play this is just simply how I play if you want to support the Channel please like subscribe and click the notification button and without further Ado let's get into how I play Dino [Music] Crisis the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to go grab the D duck station emulator simply go over to duck. org grab the windows or Android whatever platform that you want then you're going to download it and unzip it to the location of your choice when you unzip it it's going to look like this you want to open the duck station- qt- x64 that's the version with the graphic user interface before you do anything you're going to have to get a bios file I can't tell you where to get a bios file but it's pretty easy just Google when you're done go to settings bios and under here bios directory you're going to see where duck station will be looking for the BIOS you can set it there as the default location or browse and set a custom location where your bios file is once that's done you want to open your game but your game might not show up immediately to set that folder go to settings folders game list and under here you can see where your duck station emulator is going to be looking for games you can add a new folder customize it or place it in the default location you can click rescan all games and your game will show up once that's done you going to come over to Dino Crisis I already have a state loaded and here we are playing the game yada yada yada yada yada now before we get into anything like fixing the resolution what you're going to notice looks very pixelated on a modern screen we want to make sure that our controller is working and have some other basic settings figured out so I'm going to go to settings controllers go down to controller Port one choose the type of controller you want to emulate I almost always check the analog controller then once your controller is connected hit bindings and on the up press up on the left press left so on and so forth and map all the controls that you want it might do it automatically depending on what controller you use the other thing that we're going to do is go to settings under console I set the clock speed to just about 125% just to boost it a little bit above 100% this prevents slow down down without speeding the game up if you overclock it too much then the game is going to speed up under emulation I only check optimal frame pacing because I have a g-sync monitor if you don't have a g-sync monitor or a freesync AMD monitor you will want to click vertical sync and sync to host refresh rate as well I set my fast forward speed to 200% and I map it to the tab button and that allows me to hit tab anytime I'm going through a door and speed up the animations and then if I want to play a little bit faster I can hit Tab and just play at 2x speed and 2x speed is a little bit quicker but not too fast that I can't control the character and that's it those are my basic settings for this game let's move on to the next [Music] step hey the first thing we want to do is fix this super pixelated resolution the original resolution is only 320x 240 and on a modern screen it's going to look pretty pixelated so go to settings Graphics rendering internal resolution I go all the way up to 12x because I have a 4k monitor now you'll notice that at 9x there's parenthesis that says 4K this is the guess because every game has slightly different base resolution if I click 9x and then look at my resolution it is actually 2880 by 2160 that quite isn't 4K so I go all the way up to 12x which puts at 3840 by 2888 which is pretty much proper 4K next if you don't like the 4x3 aspect ratio and you want something wider that's pretty easy to fix go to settings Graphics rendering and under aspect ratio we're going to hit 20x 9 I prefer 20 by9 you will see a little bit of poping depending on the PS1 game cuz it doesn't always render all the geometry on the sides if that bothers you you can go to 16x9 but it's so minimal in this game I choose 20 by9 then you're going to notice like oh wow this is really stretched to fix that just check widescreen rendering and now I'm playing in 20 by9 and I very much like it however you're going to notice the PS1 warble much more with wide screen and high resolution you can see it right here on her face and her geometry is kind of moving around it looks odd and you're going to see it warbling during the camera movements as well so to fix that I go to settings graphics and under here I check pgxp I don't check the death buffer and then for this game I'm going to go over to the advanced tab on pgxp I'm going to check everything except for CPU mode in vertex cache the game will tell you like if I click CPU mode it's going to tell me up here it's not needed it's not always right so you might want to experiment with this but for the most part the game's going to tell you the right settings and now we look at it and we have much less weirdness in her face and when we start walking the ground and everything is not going to worble and Shimmer as the camera moves and that's it for this step that gets us to a close to a remaster but we can give it more [Music] sauce all right the first step in giving it the extra sauce is HD textures duck station as of semi recently now supports texture packs and one of my favorite texture pack creators Blackhand has an HD texture pack to get it go to this media fire link that I will put in the YouTube description below or it's also on my gaming memories resource spreadsheet that is also linked in my link tree he has a bunch of PS1 games and under under his PS1 section just simply come down and download the Dino Crisis zip folder once you unzip it it's going to have a folder that says sl- 922 where you put it by default is under documents duct station textures and place it in this folder now if you don't know where to put that or you want to change that folder go to settings graphics texture replacement and under texture directory it's going to tell you where the default folder is and you can change that to a custom folder should you so desire go to settings Graphics texture replacement make sure enable texture cast is checked then simply check enable texture replacement you're going to see some textures loading most likely and now the game has replaced all the textures with the upscaled versions from the author which for a PS1 game because those textures are such a low Bas res resolution this pack looks much better than other PS1 games that I have checked and then there is one more step we can do to give it the extra extra sauce and that is the game runs at 30 frames a second and you cannot overclock this CPU to get 60 frames a second as mentioned earlier it just speeds the game up so the only way to do that is go to steam and snag lossless scaling and once you launch lossless scaling is going to look like this at the time of recording the newest version of frame generation is lsfg 3.0 only set it to X2 set your resolution scale all the way and make sure that your duck station is running in Window mode not exclusive full screen and then you're just simply going to hit scale and tab back over to your game it is going to be running in a smooth 60fps and that's it if you'd like to see some extended gameplay footage I have a settings Showcase Video where it is about 20 minutes of the game using my settings you can check check that out there remember to share the good news of the gaming gospel and ye shall be blessed say these things in the name of me the Father coim the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeqmBIWTdk,youtube_transcript,rDeqmBIWTdk,Behold a fun but flawed attempt to remaster the PS1 CT classic AP excape since I will be using a texture pack I'm running the beetle HW core in retroarc AP excapes native resolution of 365x 224 is pretty pixelated on a modern screen particularly if you have a 4k monitor so I set the internal resolution to 16x which is above standard 4K but super sampling can subtly improve Clarity and you don't really need a beefy GPU to achieve this next I enable the widescreen hack and set the aspect ratio to 20 by9 because I'm a sucker for that wide cinematic look unfortunately like many other PS1 games Apex scape isn't going to draw all the geometry on the edges so you will see some popping on the sides but it's not quite enough for me to switch to 16x9 or all the way back to 4x3 your mileage will obviously vary depending on your taste at higher resolutions the infamous p S one wobble Shimmer and warped textures are going to be more noticeable to reduce this enable pgxp and all of its options this is a pretty good job but I tested both Beetle plus duck station and for some reason this game particularly always retains quite a bit of the wobble and Jitter no matter the settings now in terms of texture options I downloaded black hands HD texture pack and named it the game and added Dash texture Dash Replacements then I make sure I'm using the Vulcan renderer and enable track back and replace textures now we are running upscaled crispy 4K textures for the most part I enjoy this texture pack more than other PS1 packs because I think the art style of Apex Escape lends itself to AI upscaling better than other PS1 games however you'll notice some jarring black outlines here and there and texture seams will still be visible overall this isn't bother me much so I feel the packs Pros outweigh the cons lastly I couldn't find a 60fps patch for this game game and overclocking the CPU speeds the game up so I'm forced to use lossless scaling and its frame generation feature to get that 60fps look and this seems to be the extent that we can push Apex Escape at this time I do think as PS1 emulation matures we can probably revisit this title with some more tweaks in the future glory to the hardworking community that creates these programs hacks and texture packs blessed be their names and praise emulation the name of M and the Father coing the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the footage [Music] n [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the d ow yeah ow ow ya ya yeah yeah ya yeah yeah [Music] [Applause] a [Music] [Music] I'm going for [Music] it yeah [Music] yeah got yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] got got you yes [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49SMKnMHNtU,youtube_transcript,49SMKnMHNtU,Behold a somewhat successful attempt to remaster my favorite game in the series onimusha dawn of [Music] dreams for all PS2 games I run the pcsx2 emulator starting off dawn of Dreams native resolution of 512x 448 is going to look fairly pixelated on a modern screen particularly if if you have a 4k monitor so first I'm going to go to settings Graphics rendering and for internal resolution I like to set it all the way to 12x now you might be thinking isn't that massively Overkill and you'd be right it 100% is because for most PS2 games 6X is usually enough to get you a round standard 4K which is why pcsx2 labels this interval as such however we can use super sampling which means you run the game internally at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle and then down sample the image to the display resolution it's expensive in terms of overhead but it sometimes Nets you a slight increase in Fidelity particularly with objects in the distance if your rig can handle it then in my opinion you might as well do it if not then obviously I would recommend picking an interval that is closest to your monitor's resolution the next order of business is one of my favorite features of emulation and that is texture Replacements head on over to on hdrp do.com and discover the work of blessed fans Martin s and Murad 58 who have meticulously upscaled and reworked every texture in the game they also have optional textures for like alternate costumes such as a Santa themed SOI to use the Pack download it double check the folder's name the serial number of your game which for the North American version is plus 21 1880 and place it in your textures folder which is usually located in documents pcsx2 textures then go to settings Graphics texture replacement and enable load textures now you're running upscaled crispy 4K textures H now you might notice like I did that the texture pack does introduce slight jaggies that didn't exist before I have no idea why that would be the case and I also have no idea why enabling screen offset reduces them by 90% % but it does so I'd say check it to me this pack makes most armor and weapons look better and I think on average the environments tend to pop I only found one place where the textures genuinely bothered me and that is in Mount hay where the textures depicting sunlight coming through the trees now just break the entire illusion intended other than that and the minor jaggies I enjoy this texture pack and overall I feel the pros outweigh the cons and last last but not least I sprinkle just a pinch of reshade injecting an itsy bitsy bit of color correction and sharpening to my personal taste and that's as far as I think we can push Oni Musha dawn of dreams right now as always remember to thank the gaming gods for all the hard work those who make these emulators fan translations hacks and texture packs do Blessed Be Thy names spread the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of me and of the father coaching of the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the footage [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] There Is No Escape feel my blade that's fine that's fine that's fine feel my way there is no Escape that's fine [Music] all right let's get moving got it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] get out of here [Applause] get out of here die out [Applause] not yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXbtkg9-150,youtube_transcript,fXbtkg9-150,[Music] behold my attempt to use emulation and remaster my favorite game in the series Ridge Racer type four for this game I'm using the duck station emulator R 4's native resolution is a whopping 319 by 224 and if you're not playing on a CRT TV it's going to look extra pixelated on a modern monitor to fix this go to settings Graphics rendering and change the internal resolution to at least 12x bringing you to a crisp 4K experience if you're a fan of widescreen head back to settings Graphics rendering and set the aspect ratio to 20x 9 and make sure to enable widescreen rendering unlike many PS1 games that won't render geometry outside of the original aspect ratio Ridge Racer Type 4 handles widescreen like a godamn dream now at higher resolutions the PS1 wobble effect becomes much more noticeable to address this go to settings Graphics rendering and enable pgxp then on the pgxp tab enable all the options except this last one pgxp works absolute wonders to stabilize the wobble effect and to me elevates the experience however if you are someone who enjoys the wobble then naturally I would not recommend this setting now normally for PS1 games I leave texture filtering alone at nearest neighbor unless there's a texture pack available but R4 is an exception under settings Graphics rendering then in texture filtering enable XBR filtering keep in mind this setting is GPU intensive so if your frame rate dips it's one of the first things to turn off speaking of frame rate achieving 60 FPS in PS1 games is usually tricky while some games have built-in cheats for 60 FPS others can achieve it by overclocking the emulated CPU but usually this just speeds the game up and Ridge Racer Type 4 is no different however since R4 runs at a solid 30fps you can use lossless scaling on Steam set it to lsfg 2.0 then hit scale and tap back to your game this AI based method interpolates the game playay to give a at least to me convincing 60fps look and that is as far as I can push Ridge Racer Type 4 at the time of this recording since it is a very popular game I would not be surprised if a texture pack or a 60 FPS patch becomes available in the future remember kids praise emulation and share the good news of the gaming gospel and you shall be blessed I say these things in the name of M and Moto the father Co Jim the Son and carac the Holy Ghost amen and enjoy the footage go three minut to go you really even 1 go here we go three go go here we go we go go [Music] sweet you really strong [Music] [Music] is 3 2 1 go here go three left to go [Music] [Applause] [Music] sweet you really [Music] R sweet you really r [Music] [Music] it's a new record two mats to go [Music] sweet you really ripped through that se [Music] sweet you really R through that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] section it's a new record okay it's the final [Music] [Applause] waet you really R from that se [Music] [Applause] [Music] waet you really that [Music] [Applause] [Music] section It's the final s Mar a [Music] w [Music] [Applause] oh [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjzRlfOAEnU,youtube_transcript,cjzRlfOAEnU,today in the spare tech room I'm going to teach you everything that you need to know about emulating all the awesome games you grew up playing now with this you'll have the ability to play these games on whatever device you have phone tablet or computer but for the sake of this video we're going to stick to Android devices but the rules generally apply across the board it's going to be a bit of a journey what I'm probably going to have to do is create an entire playlist for you to go through every single bit of it but this is where it starts what's up my dude your friendly neighborhood Tony here and welcome to the spare tech room where I try to channel the power of hyperfixation to help you make better Tech choices now like I said this is probably going to end up being an entire playlist going over step by step every bit of the process and in today's video I really just want to get you started so I'm going to explain a little bit about video game emulation and how that works and some of the key wordss and phrases that you're going to need to be aware of really think of this as emulation 101 everything you need to know before you actually get started downloading emulators I'll also break this video down chapter by chapter so that if you want to skip ahead to a part or if you need to go back and revisit something you totally can make sure you use that list that I link in the description box below in case you want to jump to other emulators I'll be doing individual videos for all the big consoles PlayStation 2 Gamecube Nintendo switch everything your heart desires but first we need to understand a little bit about game emulation and a couple of key words so if you're starting at zero this is what you need to know first off what's an emulator and really simple an emulator is basically a PR program that pretends to be a video game console so you're going to have a ton of different emulators some of them will be emulators that pretend to be a Super Nintendo others will pretend to be a PlayStation 2 or a Nintendo switch or an Xbox or whatever there are a ton of different emulators and they are constantly being developed and some are definitely better than others but that's what I'm here for so when you're thinking emulator you're thinking console then of course you have ROMs and a ROM is basically a file that is is pretending to be a game so you would take your ROM for something like Donkey Kong Country and play it on your Super Nintendo emulator all right pretty simple you have emulators that are the consoles and ROMs that are the games then it starts to get a little tricky so then you have things that are called bios files and there are so many different types of BIOS files but what a bios file is effectively is a key it's a key that unlocks certain emulators now not every emulator needs a bios file to run but some will not play any games until you load the BIOS file first specifically emulators for PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 they both require bios files other consoles like the Nintendo switch require what are called product keys and what I'll try to do is maybe Post in the description box below all the different types of BIOS files that you might need there's a ton of them and you definitely don't need them all some bios files in fact although you don't need them you can use them to make your emulator more authentic so for for example you can get a Game Boy bios file and although you don't need that to play any game boy games it'll create the kind of startup screen and animation for the Game Boy so it just makes your experience a little more authentic so emulators are the consoles ROMs are the games and bios files are the keys to play certain consoles there's one other thing that we'll talk about today and we'll really get into it a lot more in detail down the road but that is something called a front end now what a front end does in short is it takes all the different emulators that you have on your device and it makes them all nice and neat and collected into one location so instead of having to open up different programs to play different emulators and different games you can have it all in one location where you can tab through your different emulators and all your different games and play them all pretty easily and again we're going to get into that later on that's not something we're going to cover in this particular video so okay you have the basics you understand more or less what's needed when it comes to emulating games so here's the first thing that you're going to want to do before you get started with downloading a bunch of emulators and that is you're going to want to build out your own ROM collection now I can't tell you where to get rom files I can't tell you where to get bios files cuz there's a whole bunch of legal issues with that but what I can tell you is that Google is your friend and whenever I want to find a particular file I just Google the name of the file and sure enough usually it shows up within the first couple links so if you're looking for specific ROMs specific games or specific bios files just Google it but either way the first thing you're going to want to do before you even get your device is you want to go ahead and download and collect all of the different ROMs that you want to play then you'll take those and put each of them into their own individual folders so I'll just get one folder call it ROMs and then inside that folder I have several other folders for every single game console that I want to play games for there's an NES folder for my Nintendo Entertainment System and a PS1 folder a PS2 folder GBA for Game Boy Advance you get the idea so get all your files all your ROMs and put them into their respective folders and just go ahead and start building that collection now now one trap that you don't want to fall into is the Trap of overdoing it and I have definitely done this where you think I'm going to download every single game ever created and put them all into one hard drive now you can do that don't get me wrong but it will hinder you from moving forward so just for time sake what I would recommend is maybe just take your top 10 games for each of the video game consoles that you want to be able to play and put those into your files just start small and you can always add more down the road now another thing I want to recommend here as we're getting started and as you're building out your files and everything is whatever Android device you end up going with hopefully it has a Micro SD card slot in it now you can always put these games on to your internal storage but that's generally pretty scarce so you really want to get a good mic micro SD card now the one I have is pretty massive it's a 1 tbte micro SD card and you don't necessarily need to have something this big you do want to be cautious though to make sure that you're getting a reliable and fast micro SD card so I'll link to the one that I recommend in the description box below this thing has absolutely not failed me it's been fantastic for running all kinds of games so you can pick up a terabyte card if you want to just future proof yourself and be set for the long haul or you can get something smaller I wouldn't recommend with going with anything really smaller than 256 gigs 512 is kind of The Sweet Spot but get yourself basically the biggest card that you can afford and the cool thing about having all of your games on one micro SD card is that you can then take those games and kind of transport them over to different devices so if you end up upgrading down the road or if you have maybe a handheld system and a tablet and a phone and you want to be able to just take your entire game library with you get yourself a pretty solid SD card all right this about cover all the basics that you need to understand before we move forward with downloading emulators your homework is to get all those files and folders together and pick a solid SD card up next time in the spare tech room I'm going to walk you through setting up the most important program there is when it comes to game emulation this one app will let you play 80% of the games that you could ever want to play if you're watching this in the future I'll link to that video and play list right over here if you have any questions in the meantime fire off in the comments below and if you have any specific topics you want me to cover in the future please let me know of course I want to focus on things you actually want to know all right that's it for me I'll see you next time in the spare tech room be good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qefseBgp3Ns,youtube_transcript,qefseBgp3Ns,if you're like me you may have been wondering how all these people are playing these classic games on their pcs consoles and handheld devices with such relative ease i feel like i'm being left out how can we get in on this hello internet friends my name is nap yet and in this video i'm going to show you how to do it it's so easy and once you're set up you're going to be playing any classic game you want any time of the day or night retro arch is an all-in-one solution for emulating games from the early days of computing with systems like the commodore 64 right up to the ps2 and saturn it works on pretty much any platform pc console mac android and it's often used on single board computers such as the raspberry pi it's a breeze to set up and include such quality of life features as a complete list of all the cores you could possibly want and a facility to download them and auto configuration for things like game pads so no more struggling with arcane controller setups to get started you'll want to go to retroarch.com and download the installer for your system for me that's windows 10. i'm going to try and give an overview here since i don't know what system you're going to be using but start the program and you'll be presented with a very nice gui that is easy to navigate with a mouse and auto config should pick up if you're using a controller to be sure close the program plug in your controller and then open the program again you'll see in the bottom left that it's been detected the gui definitely feels better with a controller and i'd recommend using one even if you're on a desktop the first order of business is to download some cores for the system you want to emulate so go to the main menu and click load core then download a call a list will come up it's a comprehensive one and there'll be several options for each type of system each one corresponds to a different emulator some don't work with certain games so it's going to be trial and error so my advice would be to download all the calls for the given system that you're after let's say we're looking for the playstation click on each one of these and they'll all download for you to test once you've got your cause you need a rom for the game in question obviously the rules about emulation vary from country to country but a quick google search will generally bring up any number of sites with roms for download once you've got the rom it will generally be in zipped format sometimes the cores want you to keep the file this way sometimes they want it unzipped what i do is unzip so i've got two versions just to be sure now we need to go to the retro arch installation and create a folder i call mine games but it can be called anything this is where all your roms are going to go from this point on so drag them from your downloads into this new folder then inside retro arch from the main menu again go down to load content then navigate to the game folder that you just created click on the folder and you'll get the option to load the archive or click on the other unzipped folder whichever works this is the point at which you choose the core and like i say it's trial and error if one doesn't work try another call let's try swan station since i know that works with the game i've got here but as you can see there's an error the system failed to boot that's because we've missed an important step and that's to download the bios for the system this is the point at which people get fed up and i totally understand it there's all these steps the cause then finding the roms now you have to find the bios but trust me once you've done this step you won't have to worry about this again so there are different bios for different consoles from different regions and finding them can sometimes be a pain luckily there is a retro arch multi-system bios pack and i would highly recommend downloading this if you can find it i'll put a link in the description to somewhere that is downloadable at the time of this video once you've got this file downloaded go inside and you'll see a system folder you can see the majority of bios you could ever want or need here simply drag these into the system folder in your retro arch installation retro arch automatically checks for the correct one when you launch a rom so no need to pick and choose just drag them in there drag and forget now returning to the rom again and using the same core as before as you can see the bios is automatically detected and now the game launches so we've got everything we need it really is as simple as that once you've got to this stage you can pretty much get any game you can think of drop them into your games folder you've got access to the calls you've got all the bios you could need you're ready to go that's not all once you get familiar with retro arch there's lots of shortcuts and quality of life things for instance pressing f1 once you're in the game brings up a menu with lots of options like start recording add to favorites so you don't have to scroll through the menus to launch each time you can create multiple save states with any game you can add graphics and icons to your games you can customize the gui to your liking it really is cool an all-in-one solution for retro classic gaming i could go into much more depth let me know if you want to and i will make another video going into some of those things that i've talked about but other than that thank you for watching sub up and like i've been up yet and i'll see you next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvMDjf_Mmv4,youtube_transcript,uvMDjf_Mmv4,some of you may have used emulators or at least seen those YouTube videos that showcase games at 4K internal resolution but you'll notice doing this doesn't magically remaster the game and the main reason for this is the textures so what can we do to improve this can we upscale them and is that easy to do well today we find that out as we take matters into our own hands and remaster some older titles I first started researching into texture packs for the emulator pcsx2 this emulator has has had a massive 2.0 update quite recently that has fixed so many issues that plagued it before it's still not perfect and quite a handful of games still run better on platforms like GameCube running on the Dolphin Emulator but we'll get to that later I looked into texture packs and thought I'd only find maybe four or five from dedicated fans of a certain series but instead I stumbled across a gigantic 550 line spreadsheet of them the majority of the packs on this list are also completed meaning every texture in the game has been upscaled upscaling hundreds or even thousands of textures from these old games used to be a daunting task but now with the power of AI upscaling it's a lot more easier there's also quite a few programs that these upscales get to choose from so it's why all these texture packs aren't made equal with some of them looking very questionable in some places also the biggest shocker to me was that installing these were incredibly easy you pick a game that you want remastered go to the spreadsheet and find it if it's not there you can do a simple Google search to find one and download it then drag the folder starting with slus into the textur folder within pcsx2 and boot up the game you do have to make sure that your ROM is from the same region as the texture pack but if it's not you can actually just change the folder's name to the region that you have and then it should be compatible you can do all of this whilst the game is running too with all this in mind I got to downloading packs for some of my favorite games to see how good they were and the first one I tried was Ratchet and Clank 3 this one was one of the better ones instantly making everything look really crisp this made me realize how much textures have a huge difference on how I perceive older games in 4k it's important not to zoom in here super deep or stop and stare too much as AI can sometimes get stuff wrong but for a community pack this is better than I was expecting the only first major gripe was the text text and also icons do end up with a lot of miscalculations and questionable lines but it does still seem to achieve the effect of the UI feeling much more modern and clear besides that the environments looked really good and the characters look really nice too especially those robots overall this was a really good first impression so I moved on to downloading a ton of more texture packs for different games I tried SSX tricky Simpsons Hit and Run Burnout 3 Crash Bandicoot ra for Vortex the getaway and black all of these were on pretty similar level to the Ratchet and Clank texture pack and a lot of the games I tried I've played quite a bit without texture packs so I got this brand new perspective like seeing it for the first time if it wasn't obvious yet I highly recommend you guys try this out for yourselves the spreadsheet will be down in the description so all you have to do is head over to there find your favorite games and get to installing some texture packs obviously it doesn't come close to the level of customization that we can do for PC games but especially for the games that are stuck on the PS2 era I don't think I'll play them anymore without these texture packs and sted I'd much prefer the overall sharpness of the textures despite the obvious drawbacks AI upscaling has so now that we know the upscaling PS2 game textures on PC is possible and is also extremely easy to do I set my sights on finding out if there are any other games in particular that go above and beyond [Music] this and that's where to no surprise for me Gran Turismo 4 came in this game proves to us that there is more that you can do to a game and update its textures I've kept my eye on this game's community over the years and the amount of work that they have put into not only bring in the game to modern day but adding stuff that wasn't there in the original is incredible first off this game already holds up amazingly but a bunch of mods takes it to that next level what's better is that more recently the game has gotten one of the biggest mods that I've ever seen for a PS2 game and that's called spec 2 on the mod's website there is a list of everything that it adds and it just goes on and on the most notable stuff being enhanced engine sounds for 400 plus cars with over 130 new recordings there are also new cars events and quality of life UI improvements this mod doesn't however change much in the way of visuals so that's where a retexture mod and the HD texture pack helps us out in this department seeing all this come together you wouldn't believe that this game came out in 2004 this was the first texture pack out of all of these so far that honestly felt like they had used magic to upscale them as they just look completely different from most of the others I think if I had to guess it seems like way more time and effort has gone into cherry picking upscaling techniques and a lot of trial and error went into making these textures look the best they can there's also a de insulating patch that makes the image look a lot sharper here are the settings I used as well if you want to copy these all of these Gran Turismo 4 settings and the information as well is originally from Rowdy if you're interested in Gran Turismo 4 I'd highly recommend you go check him out he has a lot of guides on making the game look best having explored what the pcsx2 texture packs had to offer I turned my sight onto the Dolphin Emulator lots of the games that I have fun memories of in the PS2 are usually better performing and have less bugs when you instead play them on the GameCube version running on this Dolphin Emulator so my expectations for texture packs were pretty high here being that a lot of the games perform their best on here it's most likely that people will gravitate towards modding for this emulator right well the list of games on the spreadsheet that I mentioned mentioned was incredibly small compared to the one for the PS2 but I desperately wanted to try remastering one of my favorite childhood games Spider-Man 2 being a huge Spider-Man fan this game was a dream come true to me as a kid and I desperately wanted to see it in high reses fortunately despite there not being an entry on the spreadsheet I stumbled across an ambitious retexture mod on mod DB this mod is by far the best one I downloaded at this point the UI is so clean and well remade the buildings and character look incredible and best of all there are tons of different suits that you can choose from in the pack I chose the 2004 Ry suit to represent the film that this game is set in and not only did it upscale the textures but the colors and lines look so screen accurate compared to the original swinging around the city or beating up bad guys in this game's new form was such an amazing feeling it also got me thinking of how in just a few steps I had practically remastered this title like I could legitimately see a publish shipping this as a remaster not a remake but you know the remaster that updates textures brings 60fps support allows running higher resolutions the only thing it's missing is the modernized controls even though that sadly we can't make any gameplay adjustments the mod does offer the ability to choose different controller buttons that show up so for me I chose PS2 buttons which made the experience feel like I was playing the PS2 version like I did as a kid just with a new Fresh Co of pain when I finally stopped fangirling over this retexture mod I wanted to try my other favorite Marvel game from this era and that's Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction this game's texture pack was pretty basic but cleans up the visuals in a way that's non-destructive to the original art style one thing I haven't really mentioned up to this point is the lag that you'll first get when you install these packs this emulator along with pcsx2 has quite a bit of stuttering as it loads the textures in this game was especially stuttery but you can either wait it out or use usually playing for a bit and then restarting gets rid of it both emulators have options that prefetch the textures and stores it on your PC's memory to speed this process up but on Dolphin this actually made my game crash at startup so I ended up avoiding it the other amazing texture pack I needed to Showcase was the Resident Evil seamless HD project essentially a bunch of dedicated fans have put together textures for the first three Resident Evils you can actually use this texture pack on the original PC version but I was going to be testing it on dolphin for this video to be honest I tried this one before but I'm still blown away at how amazing it looks today I'm really glad Modas are keeping these Originals alive especially when the remakes of these games now exists this pack is still using AI so again it's not perfect but it's still impressive for a fan-made mod I can't wait for the tech to evolve to a certain point where fans can quite literally remaster a game in one click of a button especially with stuff like RTX remix coming to the mainstream that thing is way too packed with features to go through on this video but not only does it let you add RTX lighting but it also lets you replace textures and where the light sources are as well it's the closest we're going to get to having proper access to the dev tools of any game that it supports it's going to be absolutely crazy to see what kind of mods and fan remasters come out of that and maybe I'll showcase some of those as and when they come out if you want to try any of these texture packs or mods that are featured in this video they're all going to be down linked the description so if you want to try any of them out I highly recommend you do so so we explored the crazy world of fan texture packs and how much talent and effort has gone into making remastering old games so easy that anyone can do it but what's knowing to remaster these games if you don't know much about the emulators themselves that's why you should probably head over to my ultimate pcsx2 setup guide that has a lot of tips and great practices that will help get your games looking their best see you over there [Music]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-9DHfiS48A,youtube_transcript,n-9DHfiS48A,being one of the best selling games of all time Grand fft Auto San Andreas has gotten too many ports to count over the years and due to emulation many of these ports are playable on PC making deciding on which one is best challenging that's why in today's video we're going to be comparing every option that you can play on PC we are going to be covering the PS2 Release running on the pcsx2 emulator the original Xbox release also running on an emulator the original PC version on Steam and the definitive edition so for today's episode let's answer the question what is the best way to play GTA San Andreas the first option we're going to be looking at is the PS2 version running on the pcsx2 emulator it offers numerous options to balance authenticity and modernization you can use the default settings to preserve the game's original aesthetic the best thing about this version is the reddish color grading on everything this filter captures the nostalgic San Andreas fill but does cause some issues that we'll get into later the big advantage to playing it on this emulator is experiencing San Andreas with its original visuals intact including PS2 exclusive features that might be missing on the later ports one of my favorite things to do with these emulators is use a CRT Shader my favorite go-to one is CRT Royale which is in reshade meaning you can download reshade to any emulator that you want it to work on these shaders look their best at lower resolutions so I'd recommend setting the internal resolution to something like 7 20p an alternative option is switching to software mode by pressing F9 this feature provides the most accurate rendering virtually identical to the PS2 but has to be at the native PS2 resolution however because we have the CRT Shader this doesn't actually look that bad it's also worth noting that this renders the game using the CPU instead of your graphics card which can be demanding depending on your Hardware this option is ideal for those seeking the most authentic retro version of San Andreas emulation can however present some challenges you may notice ghosting effects behind cars and characters due to the game's original filter removing this filter solves the issue but also removes the game's color grading destroying its visual style the draw distance also can't be changed meaning it's super low due to the PS2 not being as beefy as Modern Hardware this results in Popin and low detail LOD models that tend to stick out quite badly this is especially noticeable at higher resolutions the loading screens are also really ly the PS2 version of this game actually has a 30-second timer regardless of Hardware capabilities whereas the other versions that we'll get to later have different loading times depending on your Hardware here are the settings I've been using to get the game to look as clean as possible just pause and copy these if you want to while pcsx2 offers arguably the most authentic way to revisit San Andreas on PC let's go on to the next version and see if there are any better now as expect in this port and its emulator to be garbage but to my surprise the experience was actually great xmu whilst extremely basic offers great performance and is largely due to the Xbox being way less complicated to emulate than the PS2 the original Xbox Port of San Andreas however removes the iconic reddish filter that defines the PS2 Release dramatically altering the game's visual identity and atmosphere the visuals are also cleaner overall and seem less Blurry its personal preference whether you prefer this look over the PS2 but to me both look great however despite these advantages I can't fully recommend the Xbox Port is the best way to play San Andreas the removal of the signature filter and other PS2 specific features significantly changed the game's feel it's comparable to playing other remastered versions of games with altered color grading it might look cleaner and modern but it loses some of its original character think of Metal Gear Solid 3 without the green a significant drawback is the lack of customization options when using ximu unlike PCS X2 which offers many settings to tweak xmu provides far fewer ways to fine-tune your experience this isn't the end of the world but it's something worth noting for example there are no built-in native widescreen patches like there is for pcsx2 the Xbox version is stuck in a 4x3 ratio and you can of course for 16x9 but it causes everything to be super stretched the ghosting effect we also saw in the PS2 version is still present here as well which can be quite distracting during gameplay this version surprised me because the original Xbox version was actually so close to being the definitive version if it was not for removing the filter if we could somehow combine the performance of the xemia emulator with the iconic visuals of the PS2 Release then we'd be set but as we start to move on to look at the PC version you'll see how mods might actually allow us to do this the modding Community has put in some serious work and due to the customizing nature of PC games it opens up a whole world of ways to enhance the experience but before we get to that let's just look at the base official PC port and see what that brings to the table the steam release of San Andreas is often considered a flawed Port it should have modernized the experience but rather it's a complete mess Rockstar released a steam version to bring San Andreas to Modern PCS aiming for better accessibility and up-to-date features however this Port ignored many fixes from earlier patches leading to the broken Port we have today while it introduced great controller support and wider resolution options these improvements were overshadowed by its significant issues the biggest negatives here are the removed music tracks due to licensing and also a broken frame limiter which makes the FPS incredibly choppy you can turn off this Frame limiter but like a lot of older games it completely breaks the game's physics making some missions in impossible to complete it's of course possible to mod the game and it's actually really easy to do so the first important thing is to actually downgrade the game from its steam version by downgrading the steam version to the 1.0 retail release you'll restore removed content and increase mod compatibility this process then opens up the use of mod packs there are a few available through the steam guides page but I picked this one you can choose whichever one sounds best to you however this process also took me maybe 15 minutes and a lot of the time was actually spent downloading the mod pack itself the downgrader is a super straightforward installation setup and then the mod pack is zipped and a simple drag and drop into the game files this totally transforms the port from one of the worst to one of the most definitive ways to play this game the iconic visuals of the PS2 are here along with the improved performance and frame rates you get from a PC version the problem of draw distance and Popin issues are also practically not here anymore these mod packs also o offer bug fixes restored features and gameplay enhancements combining the best elements from different versions into one ultimate San Andreas experience things like the frame limit I mentioned earlier are pretty much fixed here meaning you can play at higher frame rates whilst this is an amazing way to play there is still one version that we need to get to the definitive edition this version should have been the best way to replay or play the game for the first time but it just sucks even after updates when Rockstar first announced the definitive edition of San Andreas it was exciting to finally get a modern take on the classics however the release did not meet expectations we were promised improve graphics and gameplay enhancements whilst maintaining the classic feel but what we got was an absolute disaster simply put the game just looked extremely dumb and Goofy it made the game look like The Sims and I just never understood why they went with this art style there was some good in there though they introduced features inspired by GTA 5 including modern controls updated mini Maps improved drive by shooting and the ability to restart failed missions immediately the negative reception was immediate and widespread many felt that this version failed to capture the essence of San Andreas introducing new problems instead of enhancing The Experience even after initial updates visual glitches and performance issues persisted there was a pretty big recent update that added the feature Classic Lighting mode which recreates the original game's atmosphere it also came with significant improvements to weather effects particularly the rain while these efforts have improved the game I just still cannot get behind it due to the foundation that is the art style I don't think they're going to change it anytime soon the definitive edition of San Andreas is in a better State than at launch but it still struggles to fully capture the magic of the original it's fun to play for those who want the moded controls and quality of life features but I can only recommend this version to someone that has played the original thousands of times and just wants a different way to experience it I'll be it a pretty strange way to do so with multiple versions available it's important to compare them directly now that we've gone through each version let's examine how each version Stacks up in terms of visuals performance and overall gameplay experience and then decide which version I recommend you play after exploring all these versions and tweaks you might wonder which one comes out on top the truth is the best way to play San Andreas depends on your preference and priorities we've seen that each version has its own strengths and weaknesses the pcsx2 emulation offers that classic PS2 look whilst emulating the original Xbox Port provides smoother gameplay the steam version is easily the worst out of these three but becomes super impressive with the right mods and then the definitive edition despite its improvements still faces challenges with its art style the key question here is are you prioritizing that authentic retro experience or the most modern experience possible for those craving Nostalgia the pcsx2 emulator is a no-brainer and put a CRT Shader on it as well if you want that full retro experience if however you're after the best graphics and performance a heavily modded steam version is your best bet it's going to give you the cleanest image whilst retaining that original style after considering all the options though I need to recommend the modded steam version as the best overall experience it offers A Perfect Blend of Nostalgia and modern improvements allowing you to customize the game to your liking with the right mod pack you can recreate the PS2 Aesthetics whilst enjoying the better performance that comes with the PC version as well as expanded content and a ton of bug fixes however each version has its merits and your choice comes down to your personal preference whether you're looking for Nostalgia or a modernized take on the classic there's a version of San Andreas that fits your needs I'm also interested to hear your thoughts which version of San Andreas do you prefer and why as we wrap up our journey through the various versions of San Andreas I hope this comparison helps you decide which one is best for your next playthrough or your first playthrough I'm also curious to see what classic games you would like to see covered on the series if you wanted to try San Andreas on the pcsx2 emulator I think you should watch My ultimate guide on how to set it up it's super simple and easy to follow so I recommend going over there if you're a beginner to all of this but if you're experienced it might be a good refresher course in order to get back into emulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvujTeMJ8Lg,youtube_transcript,jvujTeMJ8Lg,if you're looking to replay Grand fft Auto Vice City or play it for the very first time and you're wondering what the best way to play the game on PC is then you've come to the right place on this channel I help you get older games looking and playing their best by guiding you through the noise and getting to what matters and what matters is what versions mods settings and emulators should you be utilizing to get the most definitive experience a little disclaimer before we start this video is not a comprehensive comparison of all the versions that are playable on PC but rather a concise yet detailed highlight on how you can refresh this title and get the best possible experience on Modern Hardware what we'll be covering in this video is the PS2 release of GTA Vice City running on the pts X2 emulator the original PC version of the game and the definitive edition all of these have different purposes depending on your preferences so we'll go into each version and why you should or should not choose them with all that out the way together let's find out what is the best way to play GTA Vice City the first way you can play this game is one of the simplest as it doesn't require much tinkering at all and that's the original PS2 version of the game running on the pcsx2 emulator everything I mentioned be it mods or emulators will be linked down in the description so head down there grab the pcsx2 emulator and then all you need is a legal copy of the game I have a guide on getting this emulator setup on my channel so if it's your first time using it and need some advice you can head over there now this spefic specific version of the game is very nostalgic and is a pure way of experiencing it there are a few versions of the PS2 Release that you should look out for the original 1.40 version is the most pure way of playing the game as it is literally the first release but it does come with three bugs one of which can corrupt your save game the 2.01 version's major change was that it fixes these bugs but removes the song running in the night from The Flash FM radio station it also changed the look and the names of some weapons due to licensing issues for example the cult 45 was renamed to just pistol then the 3.0 version removed even more with tear gas being removed and also some dialogue was changed due to some controversy out of these versions here if it's possible for you to find the original 1.40 or 2.01 either of those are great if you don't care about the changes from 1.0 to 2.01 then 2.01 is the better version as it fixes those gamebreaking bugs now that you know what versions are the best then we can get back to appreciating the looks of the original version of the game booting the game up for the first time you'll have something that looks like this so you need to make a few changes up in the top you'll see that there are game properties these are properties that will only change for the specific game you should enable widescreen and the 60fps patch then you'll go into the regular pcsx2 settings and change your internal resolution I'm choosing four * native which is 1440p but you choose what you want or what your PC can handle lastly set anistropic filtering to 16 times that covers pretty much everything I would change about this version and at this point you'll have a GTA Vice City that looks and runs pretty great some side notes here are the blurriness or the ghosting that you can see here can actually be switched off in the settings the setting is called Trails this makes the game look a lot flatter and neutral but it gets rid of the haziness this is completely up to you as it's entirely subjective so just choose off or on depending on which one you like the look of another thing worth noting is that in this exact same menu there'll be a widescreen option please make sure that this is on now let's move away from emulators and try the original PC Port of the game this port is absolutely broken but with mods becomes easily the most definitive and best way to play off the rip the default PC Port has super weird feeling controls and it also doesn't have the ability to turn on Trails so you're force with this more neutral look the other annoying thing about this version is the availability since Rockstar listed the game off steam the only legal way to get your hands on it is through the Rockstar launcher and the prices here are pretty crazy this is still one of the cheapest ways as getting a steam key for the game nowadays sets you back quite a bit if you have the money though then I guess the cheapest option to get it is through the Rockstar launcher the elephant in the r is obviously getting a copy through piracy means but you'll have to go down that path on your own as I can't provide any information or links there once you get your hands on a copy of the game for PC though moding it could not be simpler and there are two ones out there that I would recommend the first is revised this is by far one of the best remasters out there as of recording this video it's one of those remasters that does not interfere with the original PS2 games Vision that means there are mods here that add features back to this PC version like the Vice City colors but they do it in a better way you see the mod here is sharp trails and what this does is bring the warm colors but removes the blurriness and ghosting that you get in the PS2 version I personally much prefer this look more details this mods adds are manually placed props and details throughout the whole world better quality weapon models which restore the original names as well that we mentioned earlier and also the UI and loading screens are manually upscaled you can read every change in the big Google doc that I link below there you'll also find the link to the download as well the install for this could not be easier either as all you need to do is drag all the files into your existing GTA VI City install and then boot up the game I can't really say what I originally wanted to say in this bit of the video but if you read the download and use section of the Google Doc you'll realize that the installation guide makes it clear the download doesn't just contain the mod files so do whatever with that information this revice mod does have a few subjective changes like in the vehicles so if you want something that just fixes bugs and restores all the features from all the best versions of this game then the improved classic mod pack by granan is the good second option this again is a quick install and a simple drag and drop into your game files is all you need to get the mod installed this one is similar to revised in its looks and gameplay and honestly you really can't go wrong with either of these they both give you that feeling of having a PC remastered version of the game arguably a more definitive experience than the one that Rockstar Games gave us which Speaking of we have to talk about a tiny bit see in my GTA San Andreas video I actually saw quite a lot of people tting it as a great way to play the game which was surprising to me so I gave the Vice City Definitive Edition more of a shot this time to see if I could recommend it and to be honest it wasn't terrible this was my first time playing this version of the game and the updates that they have been doing to it since release have clearly done something I don't think I'll ever be able to see this art style that they went for anything but ugly and I still really do not like how the characters look besides Tommy Vette he actually looks quite decent here but overall My First Impressions were not as bad as my previous ones of this version The Classic Lighting setting is a must as it brings the vicity colors back to the game and with patches fixing things like bugs that were plaguing the launch of the game the only real downside of this version is that you're going to be missing some songs but still missing some songs from the original game kind of makes the definitive edition tag that this game has questionable as it doesn't contain everything that the original has besides that though the biggest plus to this version is by far the modern controls and GTA 5 style mechanics things like shooting driving and flying feel a whole lot better in this version I think the modernized gameplay and updated visuals does make it more accessible to a lot of people and I do know a lot of people that can't put up with older Graphics when they come to play these games however this series is not about that this is about finding the absolute best ways to play an old classic and this version just Strays too far away from that original game G that I cannot recommend it I still wanted to include it however so that you know it is not a terrible option and I think that if you're someone that has played the game a bunch of times and you want to revisit it then this will be a refreshing and interesting way to replay it and that brings us to the final verdict of the video these three ways of playing GTA VI City are arguably the best but we must Crown one of them the winner and on my previous video in the series it does of course come down to many factors firstly if you are somewhat of a purist and want the closest to the original experience you can get on PC then you cannot go wrong with emulating it on the PS2 emulator over the years this emulator has come closer and closer to looking just as the original Hardware does and the benefit of being able to choose if you want to crank it up to 4K internal Resolution Run it in widecreen and so much more is really great if however you are someone that wants a more modernized experience that is easy to set up collects the best version of every game into one definitive package then you need to go with the original PC Port but with mods if you're playing Vice City for the first time then I think revised is a great choice and will give you an amazing first impression and experience throughout but also the improved classic mod that we mentioned is also great so just choose either of those and you're going to have a great time it might become a running joke on this series that we continuously pick the PC port with mods But ultimately this series is about bringing those classic games into the modern era and enhancing them enough that they do not just become playable in Modern Hardware but fix a lot of the bugs that are inherent in these ports and breathe new life into them and PC with mods tends to do that a lot of the time it's also important to me that I hear from you so if you disagree or agree with anything in this video or would like to add some feedback to the series then I would love to hear it I want this series to be the ultimate place to go if you want to find how to play any Retro Game best on PC and I also want to say

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkR5lc4tD5A,youtube_transcript,nkR5lc4tD5A,if you're looking to replay GTA 3 or play it for the very first time and you are wondering what the best way to play the game on PC is then you've come to the right place on this channel I help you get older games looking and playing their best by guiding you through the noise and getting to what matters and what matters is what versions mods settings and emulators should you be utilizing to get the most definitive experience a disclaimer before we start this video is not a comprehensive comparison of all the versions that are playable on PC but rather a concise yet detailed highlight on how you can refresh this title and get the best possible experience on Modern Hardware what we'll be covering in this video is the PS2 release of GTA 3 running on the pcsx2 emulator as well as the original PC version of the game and of course the definitive edition all of these have different purposes depending on your preference so we'll go into each version and why you should or should not use them with all that out the way together let's try and answer the question what is the best way to play GTA 3 GTA 3 was originally made need for the PS2 and since the pcsx2 emulator runs and looks great on PC then this is a really valid option to play through the game this game in particular does actually look slightly better on the original Xbox version but the problem with that version is that the emulator for it is nowhere near as developed as the PS2 emulator so we're going to be sticking with this as the best route to play the original when you have the game running you want to double click to see the options on top and then you want to select game properties here you'll need to go into the patches Tab and enable all the patches that you see here one thing to note here is that the 60fps patch can be problematic and cause some stuttering this was the case in my experience so if you have some frame rate issues the first thing I would do would be to disable this option and see if it fixes the issue outside of the game properties and into the general options of pcsx2 you'll also want to crank the internal resolution to something that you like the look of but also that your PC can handle I like to run all my PS2 games at 1440p which is my monitor's resolution also set and ropic filtering to 16 times as not only does this make the textures look a little bit better but it also doesn't really cost any performance and after these tiny tweaks you're pretty much ready to play the game the PC Port which we'll get into isn't super hard to get set up but this is such a quick plug-in playay method that will let you play the game quickly whilst also being one of the most authentic way of playing it on a modern PC speaking of the original PC version of the game is for those that want a more modernized experience something that will offer better control frame rates and visuals similar to other GTA titles we have covered on this channel so far the most annoying thing about this version is the availability see Rockstar Dlisted the original games from Steam when the definitive edition came out so that means that we're going to have to find other ways to get a copy of the game the first option would be the Rockstar Games launcher they sell the whole trilogy on there as a bundle you can also buy a physical disc copy of the game really cheap on secondhand marketplaces then all you need to do is install it from the disk and get a no CD patch all this patch does is stop Windows asking you to put the dis in every time you want to play of course that's the easy part about this because a lot of you do not have disc readers in your PC nowadays the other way to get your hands on a copy is for a steam key but the prices are pretty crazy here due to limited availability of course there are other ways to get a copy of this game online but we can't go through that information on this channel when you do get a copy of the game you'll want to mod it in order to a fix a lot of issues with the pore and B add back features that are missing to make it more definitive the easiest way to get this version fixed is using the improved classic mod pack if you're unsure about modding your games then don't worry because this could not be simpler go to the steam guide page that will be linked down in the description click the download link and then open the downloaded archive open the folder within this archive and then go to the main files folder and then inside that you want to drag all of these files into where your GTA 3 files are for steam that's easily done by right clicking the game and going browse local files then you just need to drag all the files from the archive into your game directory and say yes when prompted to override you can then just launch the game and start your playthrough the powerful thing about this mod pack is that it's not changing or adding anything subjective it's simply fixing what's broken in the original PC port and restoring lost content for example many of the highquality audio files are ripped from the PS2 version for this mod and the better vehicle models and details from the original Xbox version are ported here as well this makes the PC version a definitive collection of everything great about every port the other amazing mod for this version is re3 which is a project that reverse engineered the game the problem with this is that Rockstar shut down this mod so getting your hands on it is quite difficult there will be a steam guide that will be linked down in the description that helps you get a link for it using the way back machine you may get an error clicking this link like I did but if you just click show all here you'll be taken to a different page where you'll click the Blue Link that you see on screen here and then you'll get a list of all of the archive download links for the mod clicking the top one on this list will just start the download straight away installing this mod is pretty much exactly the same as installing the improved classic mod pack all you need to do is open the downloaded archive and then drag all these files into your GTA 3 installation the only difference here is that you'll need to be now opening the game using re 3.exe instead of GTA 3.exe if you're using a platform like steam then steam is going to open that GTA 3.exe so all you need to do here is delete that exe and rename the re31 to GTA 3 now when you open this game up you can go into the options and see that this mod has added a ton of new things that you can change the most notable ones being the aspect ratio you can also change it to full screen or Window mode and it also supports the ability to adjust the anti- a listing some other really cool features is being able to change the look of vehicles with the vehicle pipeline setting mat effects is the PS2 look and Neo is the original Xbox versions look this mod also adds a few quality of life features to the game such as the ability to retry missions when you fail GTA 3 is quite a difficult game without this feature so if this matters to you then this mod is the way to go these are only a few of the things that this mod adds as the mod's pretty extensive so I highly recommend you check out Cat macaro's video on this as he goes quite more in depth the last version I wanted to touch on very quickly is the definitive edition of the game it's slowly grown on me over the past few videos and similar to Vice City I think it actually looks and plays pretty decent I didn't want to totally neglect this version and ignore its existence but I also don't want to talk about it much in this video because this video is about finding the best way to play the classic GTA 3 game and this version Strays way too far away from the original art style for me to fully recommend it if you do go with it just out of easy access and availability then I completely understand and my only recommendation is that you make sure you you utilize the Classic Lighting setting in order to get as close to the original look of the game as possible with all these versions highlighted let's try to answer that question that we asked at the start of the video if your goal is to relive this classic title in the most pure way possible then please go with the PS2 version running on the pcsx2 emulator whilst I personally prefer to play the PC version of these older games with mods and tweaks I can't argue with the fact that if you want the original experience then you have to play the original game and this method offers that just be aware that choosing this method also means that you're going to get inferior performance and visuals due to this being an older title you can't unfortunately change things like draw distance so you're getting what you're given with this version if however you are someone that wants the more modernized experience with all the modern Comforts that PC brings then I think re3 is the way to go it's so simple to set up and fixes most if not all the problems with the PC Port I think simple additions to the game like the mention retry mission feature makes this title way more accessible and less frustrating of an experience of course if you went with emulation then you'd have a similar feature here with save states but this is such a seamless way of implementing this feature that if I hadn't known that it was added through this mod I probably would have thought that it was base game the improved classic mod pack is also great and I don't think you could go wrong with picking that or the re3 mod playing these two mods back to back I felt that re3 gave me a smoother experience and alongside that we also get the extra settings that we can Tinker with and it also adds quality of life improvements on top of the fixes and I think all of that gives it a slight Edge over the improved classic mod pack between these two mods which one do you prefer improved classic or re3 please let me know in the comments up next on my radar is covering GTA 4 and then we'll move on to other games and types of videos so if you have any suggestions then please let me know if you are new here and enjoy Retro Gaming content then maybe consider subscribing if you want to support support me further then my patreon is in the description as well as the ability to become a YouTube member you'll get cool perks like having early access to my videos behind the scenes stuff and a shout out at the end of each video if you want to see my other best way to play videos then I have one on San Andreas and also Vice City I'll see you over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sue4VhQgEH0,youtube_transcript,Sue4VhQgEH0,"the first thing you got to do of course is if you haven't already get your hands on a copy of the game and luckily unlike the other GTA titles this game is available on Steam as well as the Rockstar Games launcher then we need to look into what mods we can get for this game in order to begin fixing it there are a bunch that I would recommend but in order to remove the hassle of installing them all one by one I'm going to instead recommend that you look at a mod pack the improved classic mod pack by granan is one that's been featured heavily on this channel before with other GTA games and there's a good reason for it because this mod pack collects all of the mods that I would recommend in a quick drag and drop install solution this mod pack includes mods that aim to fix the broken PC Port as well as bring back visuals and effects from the console versions as well things like the songs that were removed due to licensing are also added back with this mod pack the only difference from my previous videos on the GTA games is that there are a few extra steps and mods that I would recommend to put on top of this mod pack in order toh The Experience further you see what this mod does for us is downgrade the game which is important to restore the missing songs it also has a few crucial mods such as Fusion fix Fusion fix is like a mega Community patch for the game that fixes countless issues and bugs with the ports it also adds a bunch of new settings to the game so you can Tinker your experience better the important mod missing from the list of added ones here though is dxvk what dxvk is is a translation layer that converts the game from direct X9 rendering API I to Vulcan and the reason this is important to you and me is because it provides an amazing boost to overall performance and smoothness we'll get into that more in depth later in the video for now let me show you really quickly how easy this mod pack is to install just click the steam guide page linked in the description and click the download link once you get the pack downloaded you want to open the downloaded archive open the folder within it and then open the folder main files you need to drag all of these files to your game directory if you're unsure and you have the steam version of the game then all you need to do is right click it in your library and click browse local files it's important you don't go ahead and drag the files into here though as you need to go into the GTA IV folder and this is where you want to drag the files once you've done that you want to open the PC folder and tweak the steam. file I'm going to be using the notepad++ text editor throughout this video but you can use the default notepad one and follow along all we want to do in this file is change all of the values from 24800 00 to 49600 this is so the game can utilize 4 GB of RAM this is the max that the program can use as GTA 4 is a 32-bit application remember to save this file as well now of the install out of the way it's time to get downloading the mod that is going to fix most if not all the performance issues and that's the mentioned dxvk so instead of going through the long TDS installation process of this mod I'm instead going to recommend you go to this Nexus mods page and get this version this collects both the command line inii that we need dxvk and also the config file so it's much easier to install if you've never downloaded anything from Nexus mods before then you might need to make an account in order to download you'll then go to files and click manual download on the first main file open the downloaded archive and drag everything but the file named must edit command line into the same place that we dragged the files from the mod pack then let's open the command line as you need to change one line depending on your Hardware the line we're looking for is available vid M which should be at the top the default value for this is 4096 what this is basically telling the game is that the available vram is 4 GB if you're unsure then you can type DX dag in the Windows start menu click no when asked and then go to the display one tab this should be where your graphics card is and the value that you're looking for is the display memory as you can see this value is in megabytes and we don't really care about the extra numbers on the end only the it's 10,000 which means I have 10 GB of vram use this onscreen graphic to find out the value that you need to input so for my 10 GB card I need to input the value 10240 so then we're going to go back to the config file and change that value to the respective amount of vram and then once we've done that you'll need to add an extra line at the end called High 4 FPS now highlight everything in this file and copy it then save and exit this file and go to steam right click your game properties and then paste the lines into the launch options this step is pretty crucial for getting the game to recognize the commands and of course if you don't have the game on Steam then what you need to do instead is create a shortcut of the game and then paste the command in the properties of the shortcut after the target lines quotation marks like this now we are almost done here I promise the very last thing that we need to do is open the dxvk doc config file hit crlf within this file and search for d3d 9. Force aspect ratio you want to input your monitor's aspect ratio inside the quotation marks for most of you this will be 16x 9 but if you have say an ultra wide monitor then that will be 21 by9 or some laptops will be 16x 10 then once you put that in it's important that you remove the hashtag at the start of the line so that it gets recognized now your GTA 4 at this point is basically all set up and ready to play the only crucial thing that you need to look out for is make sure that you're running the game at a maximum of 60 FP FPS you can play without the 60 FPS cap but the problem is is that you'll need to keep setting it back to 60 in order to complete some missions running at higher frame rates causes the physics to break in this game which does come with some gamebreaking issues that prevent you from completing some objectives that's why I think it's best to just lock it at 60 and not have to think about it if you go in game and then to settings there is now a setting in there for you to limit the FPS this is by far the easiest way to do this as it's right in the settings but if not you can always use the Nvidia or AMD control panel I haven't tested this in this game specifically but for most games setting it in your graphics card control panel usually gives you better input lag and frame times if that matters to you this is one setting within the game that Fusion fix is added the other settings are pretty dependent on how powerful your Hardware is but there are a few that I would say are strongly recommended to set for example in display the options in green are purely what I would consider personal preference so you can set these to what you want however the ones in red are settings I would recommend that you set them exactly as they are on screen things like screen filter for example should be set to default to keep the original style of the game just pause here and copy the settings in red and then set the ones in green to your liking here's the same for the graphics tab again the FPS limiter should be set to 60 if you have not set it outside of the game and from texture quality down to night Shadows these settings are not just personal preference but should be change If you experience frame rate issues specifically water and Shadow quality are quite intensive on your system so I would change those first texture quality can be left at high for most people as it depends more on the amount of vram that you have rather than the raw power of your machine having all of this set up and playing this game at a solid 60 FPS was such a great feeling this game's PC Port has always irritated the hell out of me and despite getting it to this state was quite long- winded and sometimes complicated I hope I at least made it easier to digest and understand I think the mod pack for example helps a bunch as installing all of these mods one by one would have been such a headache ultimately despite myself actually enjoying tinkering with my games sometimes you just need something quick and easy so that you can think less about the technical details and get to playing the game and with stuff like the improved classic mod pack the process becomes a whole lot more streamlined now of course there are a ton of mods for this game such as HD texture pack packs vehicle packs and graphic mods but you can't really add many of them before the limitations of the 32-bit application start to cause issues and also this series is less about remastering these older games but rather creating a definitive playing experience on PC that stays as close to the original as we can get it it was super fun revisiting this classic and seeing how far the fixes and mods have come since I last played the game covering this game was obviously a little bit different from the others in the series as we only got to focus on the PC of the game but cherry-picking what mods and settings would be the ultimate first playthrough for newcomers or a great replay experience for returning players was a lot of fun I would love to hear in the comments what you guys use when you play this game like what mods or mod packs that you recommend and now that're at that point in the video where we've answered what the best way to play GTA 4 on PC is I want to hear what games you would like to see next on the series I was thinking other Rockstar titles like Bully Manhunt and Red Dead 1 would be fitting but also Resident Evil and metal GE care franchises are interesting ones to explore if you are new to the channel and enjoy Retro Gaming content then

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE0SXJ7Vba8,youtube_transcript,bE0SXJ7Vba8,bully is one of Rockstar's more obscure titles that I think you must play and if you're coming to this video having never played it before or are going to replay it after a long time then this video is a great place to be as we are going to go through the most definitive ways you should experience it I actually never got to experience how great this title was until later in life due to my parents restricting it when I was a kid this was mainly because of the setting being a school and of course the marketing being all about bullying the funny thing is my parents were still fine with me playing GTA which still to day I will never understand having finally got to play it though it's such a fun experience to have a rockstar level story levels and freedom in a school environment and I have a lot of memories of doing all the different class activities running from prefects and riding on the skateboard so here on retr new I help you get older games like this looking and playing their best by guiding you through the noise and getting to what matters and what matters is what versions mods settings and emulators should you be utilizing to get the most definitive experience today we'll be taking a dive into the PS2 version of the game running on the pcsx2 emulator as well as the PC version to see which one gives us the best experience a little disclaimer before we start this video is not a comprehensive comparison between these versions but rather a highlight on ports that are great and what you can do to get bully playing great in the modern era so for today's episode let's answer the question what is the best way to play bully if you want the original most authentic experience then of course we are going to go with the PS2 version you'll notice that this version is just called bully whereas the PC version of the game that we'll get into later in the video is called Bully Scholarship Edition the difference between this version and the Scholarship Edition is that you're actually getting less content with the PS2 version the Scholarship Edition not only improves some of the graphics but features eight New Missions four new classes four new characters and 10 additional two-player mini games this content isn't incredible but it's worth noting that there is a decent chunk of content here that you're missing out on that doesn't mean it's a bad Port though as many believe this to be the best version of the game it's way less buggy has a smoother frame rate and of course with the PCS X2 emulator can be upscaled to 4K make sure that when you get your hands on the PCS X2 emulator that you install the latest nightly build which is what I'll be using in this video it's just so that everything you see on screen will match perfectly to my build then of course you need to grab a copy of the game legally of course then boot up the game and you should have something that looks like this now let's change a few settings if we double click you'll see the top panel show up click tools and enable show advanced settings then go to settings and game properties this is going to only change settings for this specific game so we're going to go to graphics and then the rendering tab then we're going to turn up the internal resolution to whatever suits you best for your Hardware situation I just go with 1440p as that's my monitor's resolution and looks great to me make sure that anistropic filtering is set to 16 times as well as this makes the textures sharper with little to no performance impact the blending accuracy option is also important here because increasing this from basic to medium or higher can fix some issues with the game now by issues I'm only talking minor inconsistencies with the original PS2 version but the higher you crank this setting the more accurate the rendering becomes but also the more you crank this setting up the more taxing it will become on your PC so play around with the setting depending on how power for your machine is I think if you have a decent PC then medium or high is a great starting point now the advanced settings that we enabled earlier are going to mean that there is an option here to enable manual Hardware renderer fixes when you enable this option some new tabs will appear there'll be one called Hardware fixes inside this tab next to the setting called skip draw range you need to change both of these values to six this completely removes the ghosting of the game which makes the image really really sharp another thing that you can do to help with any blurriness that you might have is the contrast adaptive sharpening setting this is in the post-processing tab the sharpen only option provides extra sharpening to the image and then the sharpness percentage can be adjusted I think 50% which is the default is a little bit oversharpened so I find something around 40 works well I myself rarely use this setting but if you want a Sharper Image then I wanted to make it apparent that it exists also underneath the TV Shader option you can enable shade boost then you can play around with these free values to get a better image I can't provide you with any exact settings that are going to make your game look great as everyone's monitor setup is different what looks good for me might not look good for you now you want to then head into the patches tab on the left and enable the widescreen patch this won't straight away work properly as you need to go into the game settings go across to display and change the aspect ratio to 16x9 this will make sure the game is not stretched at all the 480p patch is also recommended as it forces the game into Progressive mode the depth F fielded option is entirely personal preference depth F filled is a blurring effect that blurs the backgrounds behind characters During certain moments like cutcenes you'll also notice that there isn't a 60 FPS patch here like there is for most games and when you play the game you'll be playing at 30 FPS the game can actually be unlocked to 60 via manually inputting a patch but the problem with this like most older games running at anything above 30 FPS is going to cause some issues this problem also goes for all the versions so you're not really at a disadvantage here if you want to take the risk and try 60fps then you want to head to where your patches folder is for pcsx2 by default this will be inside a folder called pcsx2 within your documents folder but for me I've moved it into the directory of the emulator you want to download the patch file that I have Linked In the description and drag and drop it into this folder then when you head back into the emulator and within the patches tab you can refresh patches and the new 60fps patch should show up enabling it may seem like it's doing nothing as you may start to go over 30 FPS but you won't reach any wi near 60 to fix this issue inside the emulation tab you need to put the E cycle rate to 180% overclock this is really helpful for those of you on more powerful Hardware to achieve 60fps but again doing all of this whilst at first feels great to play this game at a higher frame rate it's just going to cause you a world of issues so use this at your own risk with all of these tweaks done you'll have an amazing original bully experience that I can't recommend enough but before we start comparing this to anything else let's take a look at how good we can get the PC Port of the game to play as mentioned before the PC version of the game features more content and improved Graphics but as with a lot of Rockstar titles as more versions come out the more broken the next one becomes at base value this game is terrible so let's do what we can to improve it and on my journey of attempting to fix this game and bring it into the modern era I stumbled across a project called updated Classic this is very similar to the mod packs that we have featured on the channel already for the GTA games this one restores a lot of features from the PS2 versions that we have praised so highly and also the Wii version believe it or not as that has some great things that we can borrow from it like textures and vehicles listing all the fixes and changes would need a whole other video so the steam guide page is linked down the description for you to have a look at as well as the download link to get it installed this is similar to the revised mod where the download is actually just just a build of the entire game so to get this build installed on Steam what you need to do is right click your game browse local files and then delete everything in here then just unpack the updated classic build into this folder and launch the game as you would through Steam but before you do that it's recommended that you go into the readme folder and then prerequisites and go through all of these folders and install all of their respective exes this is going to help you avoid many many issues there are also some add-ons to change the controller icons there are Xbox ones original PS2 ones and HD buttons from the PS3 Port of San Andreas you just need to drag the one that you want into the base directory of the game and replace when asked now the game might launch in the wrong resolution when you first open it but you can change that in the settings before starting the game trying out this version I instantly noticed that a lot of the textures are a lot sharper here on the PC version it's very inconsistent however with some things being super sharp and other things being a pixel8 mess the frame rate will also be capped at 30 FPS but I felt in my experience that this version specifically with this mod installed felt a bit smoother compared to the pcsx2 version I think it's very easy to quickly get used to this 30fps as well as in the past I've had the displeasure of playing through bloodborne on the PS4 which barely reaches that at some points the final verdict here is very straightforward but kind of non-conclusive I'm usually someone that loves modding and fixing the PC version of an older title but the Scholarship Edition does feel a tiny bit more janky in comparison to the PS2 version there was a community texture pack made for the PS2 version which did look pretty great but there was a few bugs there so I didn't recommend it in this video I think that if you are an emulator kind of person and love having that original retro Vibe then definitely go with a PS2 version but if you want to avoid emulators or you want the extra content that the Scholarship Edition brings then the PC version is not a bad pick and now that we are answered the question that was at the start of the video I want to give a big thanks to anyone that has made it this far in the video just watching until this point helps out tremendously and giving the video a like and subscribing if this helped you out or was just entertaining would mean a lot if you want to continue watching my content then how about you check out the last best way to play episode which was a bit of a marathon video where I go from GTA 3 all the way up to GTA4 or check out this video on the right where I go down the rabbit hole of emulator texture packs see you over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR1_-HveQQY,youtube_transcript,sR1_-HveQQY,the American dream come true honey I'm home but dreams have a nasty habit of going bad when you're not looking with the max pain remake being just around the corner or already out depending on when you watch this video I thought it'd be a great opportunity to revisit the original game so you can experience it in all of its Glory before playing the remakes here on retro new what we like to do is preserve older games in order to give new players the best experience possible and also returning fans a reason to come back so let's explore versions mods settings and emulators for this game to answer the question what is the best way to play max pain one the first thing you need to do is obviously get your hands on a copy of the game and that can be done through today's sponsor instant gaming max pain is on here for just under $5 and due to how speedy instant Gaming's checkout and code delivery is you can be playing the game within literal seconds you can get so many games on here old and new for prices that are lower than Steam a great feature on the website is that if you pre-order a new game and the price drops before release you'll be refunded the difference guaranteeing you get the best deal possible if you're interested then use my affiliate Link in the description or the pinned comment to help support the channel while saving you some money on games we are mainly going to be looking at the PC version for this video as there's not really much reason in my opinion to even look at the console versions whilst the Xbox Port running on the zmut emulator looks pretty close to the PC version it still will never be what we can do on PC and when I tried it out I couldn't seem to find widescreen support so I had to play it in 4x3 as well as the comic panels not showing up at all the PS2 version running on the PCS X2 emulator has a widescreen patch but it gets even more downgrades like removed areas downgraded overall graphics and way more loading screens the performance was pretty bad for me as well now the reason that PC is better isn't just because we can tweak and mod it but it's because the game was originally made for the PC and so it's the most definitive version of it so let's focus in on the PC version and see what we can do in order to fix it and get it running perfectly on Modern Hardware we'll also do some extra tweaks in order to get some Modern features back in the game like proper anti-al lising there is so much going on with this PC version that we need to fix and there are two ways of going about it the first is the tedious manual way which could take you anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or there's option two which is what I'm going to suggest in this video and that's to use a complete fix pack the complete fix pack essentially has the purpose of correcting many of the known issues with the game in such a simple userfriendly way in the form of an installer the installer also lets you select different fixes and upgrades depending on your preferences let me show you how easy is to get installed first make sure you have a clean install of the game if you've added any tweaks or mods just uninstall the game delete the game directory folder and reinstall it now download the pack via the link in the description and run the installer point it to to the directory where max pain is installed there are tips as to where you will have it depending on where you got the game from it will then ask you to select components there are highres textures that you can enable if you want to they are scaled using some AI techniques with some being handmade 95% of the textures have been replaced and they look pretty great obviously you need to set expectations with this kind of stuff as things like Signs and text tend to be not perfect of course this is up to you if you want these textures but for me I like the increase Fidelity that they bring this won't hinder performance much at all as long as you have a graphics card with at least 2 GB of vram and pretty much every modern card has this amount anyway it will however make loading times a bit longer select the steam or CD version of the exe depending on which one you're installing it for this just replaces the executable with one that allows 4 GB of memory to be used the second option will apply a startup fix the reason this is needed is because machines nowadays are obviously a lot faster than the ones during the games release in 2001 what it would cause is the game to just not start up at all it also allows us to add a directex wrapper which can take the ancient DX8 rendering API to a much newer dx11 version this is important not just because it's outdated but because Windows 10 and up tend to completely ignore settings within DX8 there are two options here the default is to go with DX8 to dx9 which is the most basic approach that doesn't need anything configured going with the DX8 to dx11 option can be useful in scenarios where you need the ability to configure things like setting the right graphics card for the game to use for this video I'm just going to choose DX8 to dx11 option just so I can show you how to configure DJ Voodoo so if you want to follow along with what I'm doing just choose that one otherwise the other option is completely viable next it will let you pick sound fixes sound is a big problem with the game with the notable issue being that it will cut out randomly the default one utilizes DS o a l this should fix some sounds not playing at all and it also will not cause any loss in sound quality second fix essentially just modifies the sound files themselves to a format that actually works therefore you do not need any sound wrapper the third is just a backup option if the first wrapper option does not work so leave it at the first one if this doesn't work reinstall the fix pack and try the second one and if that still has problems then alternatively try the third one now wi screen fix is a no-brainer because you don't want to play in 4x3 fix for AMD ryzen 3 should also be checked even if you are on AMD the only reason I see to uncheck this is if you're playing on 2001 Hardware as it may cause issues but for most of you on Modern Hardware it's nice to know this error is fixed keep the first two support files checked as they will just make sure that all the necessary redistributables are installed at the end there's a tool that lets you create mods for the game there's no harm in keeping it checked but also there's no point in downloading something that we're not going to need so I'll uncheck it now that we've gone through getting the fix pack installed let's go through the other necessary tweaks that we need to make first ly let's open the game directory and tweak the dx11 rapper like we mentioned the executable file is called DG Voodoo CPL now the fix pack has actually done this all for us but we just want to double check everything is right in the direct X tab for example just make sure that the watermark is unticked and also if you're on a high resolution like 4K then vram should be set to 1024 make sure you obviously hit apply before you close the program down I also want to recommend two more fixes the first corrects the jpeg ER is that you could run into on Modern CPUs it just needs to be downloaded and dragg into the games directory the second is the difficulty adjustments that I'd recommend the first one unlocks all of the difficulties without having to complete the game this is good for obvious reasons for returning and new players new players can now select easier difficulties and returning ones can pick the more difficult ones this is just a registry edit file so all you need to do is double click it and it'll apply all the fixes for you the second one is removing the broken Adaptive Difficulty this feat activates when you play on the standard difficulty mode it's broken because it doesn't account for player deaths properly making the difficulty very quickly scale to the hardest values making certain scenarios more difficult than they should be simply replace the difficulty. txt file within the game's directory with this new one now that we have all the fixes out the way let's go through some extra essential tweaks that we need to make to ensure we're getting the best possible image quality out of the game open in the game will show you the launcher the first things that you need to make sure is that your graphics card and resolution is set correctly and acceleration is set to d3d Hardware not software click options and then just copy the settings that you see on screen now you might notice that anti-al lising has turned off but that's just because we've come a long way since 2001 in terms of anti-al lising techniques so we're going to be adding it ourselves for anyone on lower-end Hardware what I recommend doing is setting the texture options to medium if you're using the enhanced textures for me though on a 3080 I had no problem setting everything to the highest now in game texture sharpness to the maximum and brightness to your liking lastly it's important that you cap your FPS to 144 or lower with all the fixes that we've added vsync will be forced on which will set the S to your monitor's refresh rate the problem is for me is I'm running a 240 HZ Monitor and then therefore it's setting the fps to 240 which is way too high and may cause issues so I capped it down to 144 using rever tuna you can also use the Nvidia control panel if you need to do this the game is complet deletable at or below 144 FPS according to the PC gaming Wiki my recommendation then is that if you're on a monitor that has a refresh rate of 144 or lower then you can just leave everything as default however if you're over that refresh rate number then make sure to cap it back down to 144 also if you experience any issues then just cap it down to 120 and then finally 60 60 should be without any issues so if you want to play it safe you can also just set it to that now at this point all the essential tweaks are done if you encounter any issues like sound being bugged you can uninstall the fix pack like you normally would like any other program by going to your control panel and uninstalling it then just open the installer again and choose the other options that we explained earlier now this section of the video is for some extra tweaks that take the game to the next level like adding proper anti-al lising playing in borderless Window mode and some more texture replacement mods first let's get 16 times anistropic filtering via your Nvidia or AMD control panel working you can do this on a global level or via the program settings this just ensures the textur stay crisp at a further distance to add antialising I recommend two options the first option is to grab reshade choose direct X9 during its install and on the effects page keep the defaults and check immersive effects then once you're in game open the menu by hitting the home key skip the tutorial and enable either smaa or immersive smaa then also tick performance mode here's a sideb side of what these both look like against no anti aing at all the other option is via your Nvidia control panel unfortunately I don't know how to do this on AMD but I'm sure there is a similar method if you follow along set anti-air listing to two samples within the Launcher settings open Nvidia control panel go manage 3D settings program settings find or add Max pane apply these settings on screen in bold and then hit apply this is what this method looks like up against immersive smaa I personally prefer the reshade method but if you do the driver level method then I'm pretty sure it's less taxing on performance to get borderless windowed mode it's really easy all you need to do is add this inii file within the game's directory you don't need to put anything inside this file it will just tell the game to run in borderless Window mode now now besides the texture pack we covered earlier here are some additional mods that I think you guys might be interested in these are in no way objectively better than the original but I think it's a great option to have stuff like this if you want to improve the Fidelity Max paying enemies and items HD improve the enemies NPCs max pain himself alongside weapons and items max pain echo of the past is also another great mod that restores tons of cut content from the original the read me file shows you all of them if you're interested in what it does I wouldn't recommend getting this one unless this isn't your first playthrough and you want to experience the game in a new light Marco mix's real weapons is another cool one that replaces the weapon textures with HD Ones based on their real life counterparts this mod however is not suited for a vanilla friendly playthrough of the game as it changes some of the stats of the weapons to make them seem more realistic as well worth checking out though if again this isn't your first time playing you install all of these mods in the same way just drag the data folder within your games directory and replace when asked the last extra tweak I want to suggest is my own reshade preset for the game this is an extremely lightweight preset besides sharpening the game a tiny tiny bit and adding anti- aing what the preset also does is ADD Ray traced Global illumination this is a really basic Ray tracing Shader by nce Sky and if you watch my last video where we tested it you'll know that it took a single frame off my FPS so it's really performance friendly my aim for this is making a super subtle preset that basically just lifts the game ever so slightly whilst keeping that original look if you like it and want me to make this kind of preset for every game going forward on the channel then do let me know in the comments installing the preset is super easy place the inii file anywhere and then install reshade if you already have it installed you can just run the installer again and click update effects and then all you need to do is Select my ini I in this section when it asks for it this will only install the effects that I use for the preset then in game just open the reshade menu and make sure that the preset selected at the top has retro renew in it the final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led to this point I released my finger from the trigger and then it was over after all of this you'll now have the most definitive way to play the first max pain it's super fun and different to work on games like this since the no-brain option is the PC we get to fully focus our attention on it and cover every little tweak that we can I still think there is a place for the console versions if you have any particular Nostalgia for them but if you're a new player I think the PC is the only option that you should go with so the answer to the question what is the best way to play is definitely the PC version with all of the tweaks that I covered in this video whilst we took our time exploring everything this can all be done pretty quickly there is one quir that I wanted to go over and that's that the video player buttons during the comic book section c s are gone now this is done on purpose because they are bugged anyway you can however still use the controls here's a screen cap of how you can navigate the comic panels if you want them back you can just click F2 but the only thing is due to the scaling issues you're going to have to find on the screen where the button is actually clickable as they're not going to be where they display on your screen besides that though I've played through the entire game of these tweaks before and I've encountered exactly zero crashes bugs or low frame rate if I helped you in any way or you just found this entertaining this is the exact kind of retro game content I provide so maybe consider subscribing and enabling notifications to stay up to date with my uploads I also stream here on YouTube and twitch we just chat about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28u6RoYiCWI,youtube_transcript,28u6RoYiCWI,if you've ever tried to revisit your childhood by emulating some retro games on PC only to be disappointed by how they look then you've been playing them the wrong way for years I've tried everything from original Hardware on a modern TV to of course emulating on a PC but both provide results unlike that nostalgic image we have of them in our heads but by utilizing CRT shaders correctly I turned the game from looking like this to this and instantly realize why I'd remember these older games looking a lot better so join me as I show you how I did it which shaders and settings look the best and of course how you can do it too so why do we need CRT shaders in the first place the simplest answer is that older games were optimized for the CRT monitors of the time the scan lines that the monitors had Blended the pixels in a way that made certain surfaces character models and objects look way more natural and realistic think of paintings and the texture that they have due to being painted on a canvas playing pixel art games CRT Shader is especially the biggest nightmare of them all in Sonic the Hedgehog for example you can see the massive difference in the waterfall as it goes from a mess of pixels to looking like an actual waterfall that you can see right through hopefully here you can see how important the shaders can be in seeing the game as the developers intended before we go into all the shaders available and which ones are the best for certain scenarios it's best you know how to install them my advice for getting into CRT shaders would be using a program called retroarch if you are unfamiliar with it the simplest way to describe it is that it's essentially a hub for emulators meaning this one program can use different emulators to play pretty much any game that you can throw it at and one of the great things about this is that all of your Shader presets and settings are all in one place it's however sometimes less accurate and provides way less options to Tinker with than the individual emulators do especially for instances where we want to use CRT shaders if you want to guide on setting it up then I'd be more than happy to make that so just leave a comment if you want that retroarch already comes with a ton of CLT shaders pre-installed any featured in this video that don't come pre-installed will be linked down in the description you'll head over to a certain Shader that you want to install and if it's a GitHub page then it will usually be in releases then in the assets section you'll see a zip folder with the Shader Name download that and open it with your favorite archiving tool leave it open and go to where you installed retro Arch and then drag the shaders folder you have in the zip folder into this folder and you're all done sometimes the files are a bit different like for cyberlab CRT Royale Shader you'll need to open the retroarch folder to get to that Shader folder this one also has a filters folder so that one will go into the retroarch main directory as well now to get started with CRT shaders it's first important to note that there is not a one siiz fits all solution not only do different games and consoles look better or worse with certain shaders but also you'll want to replicate the CRT monitor that you have in your head there are also many shaders that aim to replicate certain consoles video outputs through different cables to make this video as helpful as I can I'm going to go through different use cases for different shaders depending on the console and art style you may want to play I won't be going through every single console ever made and what shaders are good for them as a lot of these do have crossover and also I'd be here all day let's first take a look at 3D games around the PS1 era here's what Native PS1 looks like with stock settings running on the swan station core in retroarch you can see diing all along the walls in this scene and Spider-Man is looking very sharp and jaggy if you hit F1 on your keyboard you'll open the retroarch menu go all the way down to the bottom and click shaders in there select load preset and then select the preset that you want to try you'll also see two folders here we're going to be selecting the slang one because we're using the Vulcan renderer but if you're using something like opengl then you'll select the other folder inside the slang folder we'll go to the CRT folder and then the first one that we're going to try is new Pixy CRT with this on you can see that the diver ring is now Blended perfect perfectly and Spider-Man looks way less harsh on the eyes the Shader in specific has a very dark tone you can change any Shader settings that you want to by opening back up the menu and going all the way down to Shader parameters here you can adjust pretty much everything about the Shader from curvature that some shaders use to the brightness and contrast this won't however change the overall Aesthetics of the Shader so what you get from the Shader at default should be to your liking before you start tinkering another great Shader for 3D PS1 games is the one funs by retr crisis he's got a YouTube channel dedicated to making these shaders so I was excited to see what he has to offer and the results are pretty incredible this is the most harsh out of the shaders I tried with a heavy screen door effect on my 1440p monitor it's really really accurate but tries to replicate a quite expensive CRT for the time so it wasn't quite the look that I had in mind when I was playing it on my crappy CRT when I was a kid the next one is CRT guest Advanced this is the ntsc option for it and this one is super nostalgic for me because it does a pretty good job at replicating a more budget CRT of the time anything with ntsc or VHS in the name tends to mean that it's going to be a pretty dirty version of the Shader it can sometimes be nostalgic but also is quite gimmicky there's going to be quite a lot of grunge on the screen like the wobble that you'd get on older CRT monitors and it's a cool gimmick but I wouldn't recommend anyone playing on this instead it's recommended just to choose the normal non ntsc versions of these shaders the last one I tried was the side lab CRT Royale this one was just way too dull by default but does look very accurate to CRTs of the time I think if I had a monitor that could get much brighter then this would look a whole lot better I tried to Tinker with some of the parameters to get a slightly Brighter Image but it just didn't really work out for this type of game though I feel it doesn't work but may look better when we move on to 2D games looking at all of these side by side I really like the look of CRT guest Advanced and new pixie but retr crisis and cyber lab give an extremely accurate image accurate doesn't always mean better though and for anyone just wanting to play these games and throw on a Shader these ones are quite Advanced for the average user but let's see how they all shape up as we move on to 2D games Pixel Art is the best reason to use one of these shaders and a game like Castlevania is a perfect test bench for showing off how well CRT complements the art style of the time I recommend a Shader like gdv Trinitron for this case I don't have much Nostalgia for many 2D games but I can still appreciate how good this looks it really makes the artwork pop and I don't see why you wouldn't play this sort of game without it other shaders that I'd recommend would be the guest advanc one again and also aperture all are great options and will depend on what kind of CRT look you want to go for the shaders for the PS1 can also be applied for other consoles such as the N64 for the retr crisis and cyberlab ones you can see there are options that are specific to certain consoles and video outputs so selecting the right console here will provide you have a better image it's also worth noting that for cyberlab ones you can see that there are some of the options that say a Blog filter is recommended to turn these on you'll go back to the main menu within retroarch select settings video then click filters here you'll see loads of different blog filters to choose from the ones suggested here have loads of different versions that replicate different cables I'd recommend you choose the cable that you remember playing on as a kid or just go through them to see which one you prefer a great example of this filter working is Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis this game combined with a cyberlab CRT Royale filter makes that waterfall that we mentioned earlier seethrough which is how it should look this one specifically has RF or S video blog filters to choose from there is also a bad composite filter but that one was crashing my retroarch so unfortunately I couldn't check it out for handhelds such as the PSP there is a handhelds folder within shaders but we won't go into these too deep as they don't really add much the difference between native and with the PSP color filter on is very minor I moved on from these quickly and went into the era that I have most fun memories with and that's the Playstation 2 if you haven't guessed already from my previous videos on this channel I'm a big fan of this era of gaming but since I use individual emulators for both PS2 and GameCube I had to find shaders from elsewhere luckily a lot of the retroart shaders have been ported to reshade and installing reshade to an emulator is super simple you download the setup file from the reshade website click browse and select your emulators exe location then choose which renderer that your emulator uses for most people this is going to be Vulcan but find out which one you use for your emulator and install that one then when you ask what effects you'd like to install get CRT Royale RS retro AR and also Q Quint I'll explain all these later after that you can just Spam next to finish the installation when in game you can simply press the home key skip the tutorial and then just click whatever shaders you want on I chose to have a look at the CRT Royale one first this one is like the cyberlab one where it's super accurate but I struggle to make it look good on my monitor probably because it doesn't have great HDR and therefore doesn't get all that bright these reshade ones have quite a few settings that are worth changing to make it really easy to understand these are the main important things to Tinker with in the phosphor MK tab you can play around with the different options Shadow was to my understanding the most used among CRTs for the time but makes the image quite dark and so if you're not running a high brightness display it can be challenging to make this look good adjusting the scan lines would be the next step this tends to be adjusted depending on your resolution of your monitor so Tinker around and see what looks best there are a few options to choose in beam shape mode as well the Goran option is the best but again does need the right display for it it's also pretty important that every one of you set the gamma correctly in color and effects the two gamma options here should match so I set my CRT gamma to 2.2 to match the LCD gamma you also must set the game to use the right dynamic range for a CRT monitor the simplest way to do this is to use Marty's Lightroom Shader that's why we installed Marty's Quint effects earlier turn it on and set the Black Point to something around 16 and the white point to something around 239 lastly you'll want to use HDR on your monitor if it's available and get your monitor to the highest peak brightness that it can this is so that you can get somewhat near to how bright CRTs were the struggle here is that for me obviously my monitor isn't capable of getting there so these shaders kind of look mediocre the image I get from this is just way too dark to be playable so I set everything back to default and I adjusted the gamma so that they match and this was pretty much the best I could get it to look on my monitor there are obviously a few pixel art games that are on the PS2 and these were definitely the standout ones that I tested because this one just was a bit too advanced for my liking I tried some of the others here all of those are side by side this is actually the Dolphin Emulator running Spider-Man 2 at 720p internal resol solution let me know which one here you prefer I think guest Advance is one of my favorite new pixie is also great but does give the screen a strange green queue also out of all of these guest Advance is a Shader that doesn't come included in the reshade inst store there's a GitHub page for that one and all you need to do is drag the folders included in the zip file into your reshade Shader folder this folder can be found inside your emulator's main directory there are three shaders included in this one the normal one a HD version and the TSC version the HD version looked nice but also a bit too clean for CRT and then the ntsc version was on the other end of the spectrum being way too grungy for my liking all of these have a resolution setting as well so you can Tinker with that depending on your monitor's resolution I found that somewhere around 480p worked pretty well I've pretty much non-stop been looking at CRT shaders for a week straight so I think it's good we end the journey here for now hopefully you have a basic understanding of CRT shaders how to get them and why you should should use them but I want to hear your thoughts what games do you think look incredible with these shaders and what are some of your top tips to help out those just getting started playing retro games on PC if you want to go the other route and make your retro games look super modern then check out the left video where I explore remastering old games with texture packs or the right video where we go over every version of GTA San Andreas to see which one of those is the best way to play that classic title see you over there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD3LPvnadZY,youtube_transcript,VD3LPvnadZY,"I consume a lot of mods, texture packs, and tweaks in any of the games or emulators that I play. But what I'm not is very smart. So, the thought of creating anything that I consume is extremely daunting to me. So, I came up with the idea to try my hand at remastering a game from my childhood all by myself. And I don't mean taking someone else's work. I mean literally by myself, all by hand trying to remaster a game. And to make it even more stressful than it already is, I'm going to give myself exactly 10 days to do it. So, join me on this journey as I try to remaster a game from my childhood all by myself. But first, a word from our sponsor. We all love video games, but what's better than games is games at a fraction of the price. And that's exactly what you can do here on Instant Gaming. By far the best thing about Instant Gaming is that it's not your usual marketplace key site. All of the keys here are sourced directly by Instant Gaming themselves. Therefore, you never have to worry about getting a dodgy key and also the keys are just delivered incredibly fast. But I know this from personal experience. I've been on this platform buying games since 2018 and I have not had a single issue. So, if you're interested, use my affiliate link in the description to save yourself some money on great games whilst also supporting the channel. Let's get back to the video. To make this easier on me as a beginner, I tried to pick a game that was extremely moddable and easier to tinker. So on day one, I basically made a list of all the games that I would consider remastering. And I very quickly decided that I wanted this to be from the PS2 era of games. Not only is this the era that I grew up in, but also these games are kind of somewhere in the middle. They're not the PS1 where they're really blocky and hard to remaster, but they're not the Xbox 360, PS3 games where some of them actually look quite good even to this day. PS2, therefore, is in that sweet spot where everything is kind of just not to modern standards. And I think upscaling it is going to give the biggest difference. I eliminated a few games from this list instantly that just weren't fitting the bill. For example, games with cartoony art styles such as Ultimate Spider-Man aren't really exactly the perfect candidate for remastering. As this art style ages extremely well, and because it ages quite well, it's not going to be that drastic if I remaster it. So, I got it down to five games. And then I just ran a poll on my channel in order for you guys to decide which game I was going to ultimately remaster. And overwhelmingly, the poll went to God of War. Out of all these games, it's actually the one that I played the most. So, it was kind of a stroke of luck that this one got chosen. I was hoping at this point that the experience with the game might help me a little bit in remastering it. Also, it does help that this game was so ahead of its time in terms of visuals. So, I kind of had a little bit of a head start here. So, I started by figuring out what I was actually working with here, and my assumptions were correct. This game has held up extremely well. And the moment that I booted it up, I was already using the default 4K settings that I usually use. So basically right away this game was looking amazing. This obviously isn't how we remember it. So I set everything back to default to see how it actually looked back then. This is why I love emulation. It's just so accessible. Like the fact that I can do a single click and get this game running in 4K is basically a free remaster in of itself. I began first doing the simple things like tweaking the settings. So the 4K internal resolution for example, as well as anastropic filtering set to 16 times. I also played around with the adaptive sharpening option within PCSX2 and I actually quite liked it. I set it to 60% and it did give the game that much needed bump in sharpening. Also, this effect doesn't oversharpen the image even at 100% which was really nice. Besides that, the obvious thing that stuck out like a sore thumbnail at 4K was the textures. We're dealing with 512x 512 resolution textures here. And to put that into perspective, nowadays in modern games, we're dealing with textures four times the size of that. I think nowadays most games have 2K textures and reserve the 4K textures for a high resolution texture pack. Those high resolution texture packs alone sometimes run at about 80 GB and they don't really make that much of a difference as 2K still looks really good. So, what I'm going to do for this texture pack is remake some of them in 2K if I feel that it's needed, but also 1K is just fine. So, I'm going to just mix match both of them. I went ahead and picked out a few spots in the game that I wanted to see remastered. I want to see the title screen specifically looking really high-res, and I'd love to be able to upscale the font and the logo. And then, I want to try the very first section of the game on the boat. I want all of the planks on the floor and the rope all to look high-res, as they're looking really blurry here. And I really didn't know how hard or difficult this was going to be. So, at first, I was just going to prioritize the little things in the scene that stuck out in order to not waste my time. I thought that starting small like this was a really good idea, so I stuck with that. I then found this scene with these two statues that I really wanted to upscale. And then lastly, if I had the time, I really wanted to upscale the Olympus throne room. The skulls, pillars, walls, carpet, all of it's just a tiny little bit blurry, and I think this would look incredible upscaled. Now, I've been using Photoshop for over 10 years now, and I was also a professional graphic designer at one point. So, I'm hoping since I have a little bit of Photoshop knowledge, it would carry me through the challenge. I did some light research on texturing and PCSX2 textures and all that and I realized that I was way out of my depth here. Like for example, I would say I tend to play around with mods and files and settings a lot more than the average gamer. But when it comes to actually making this stuff, I mean, I have no clue. So I capped off this day feeling pretty worried about the road ahead. So I started figuring out how to actually dump the textures of the game. And surprisingly, there's a lot of information online. I went down the rabbit hole here and basically there's a guy called Sad Origami which if you've watched his channel before I showed a spreadsheet with loads of different texture packs and that spreadsheet is made by him. He's at the moment remastering Shadow of the Colossus and he's doing a really great job at it. And on his links page I saw a Discord. Now I'm not sure if he owns this Discord but it's basically a server dedicated to retro texture packs. And once I had gone in there, there was a resource channel with a texture pack modding guide, an 8-page long guide on everything about texture packs and modding them into the PCSXU emulator. It felt like I honestly had hit the jackpot. But then my high was quickly crushed when I read the very first sentence of the guide that said that the PCsuit emulator is one of the most challenging ones out there to make texture packs for. Hopefully, they're just saying it was challenging and they've figured it all out and they're going to tell me all the secrets. So, I carried on. So, what I found was the way texture dumping works in PCSX 2 is it essentially just dumps the textures that are being loaded in as you're playing. This means if you want to remaster the entirety of a game, you have to play it all the way through. With this in mind, I stood in the boat scene of the game and started to dump the textures. To do this, you just go settings, graphics, texture replacements, and then click dump textures. In here is a bunch of game codes, and I just had to find the one that was correspondent to my copy of God of War. And in that folder was every single texture from this boat scene. So I put them into Photoshop to see exactly what I was working with here. And they were almost completely transparent when I opened them. I could obviously just duplicate the layer over and over again to bring back the opacity, but I referred to the guide to see if there was anything there. And they said this kind of behavior was normal with PS2 textures to run at about 50% opacity. And it also pointed towards a tool that you can use called alpha channel remover. You can input all of the textures into this tool. It will tell you what opacity all of them are running at. and then it will also convert them to 100% opacity so that you can edit them. It's important that after you edit them, you turn them back to whatever opacity the program told you. For God of War textures, all of the ones that I imported were at 50%. And with now a fully opaque texture, what I did was just upscale it to four times using Photoshop scaling methods. And this just kind of looked like I'd smeared Vaseline all over the texture. So, this was not the ideal approach. A lot of resources point towards using an upscaler called ESR Gan. But what I noticed was that this program is very similar to something that I use for my YouTube thumbnails. Whenever I want to upscale something that's really blurry online, I use Gigapixel. And from my experience using it, I've put in some pretty bad low-res images and got really good results out of it. So I thought that maybe using this for my textures was going to save me a lot of time. So I tried it on the rope texture and yeah, this looks nothing like rope. The standard model makes it look kind of like dried grass. And then the art and CG model makes it look kind of like a wood carving. And then low resolution is kind of like an abstract piece of art. The upscaling was just not really understanding of what it was in the first place. So, as a last resort, I tried out Gigapixels new V2 recovery model, and this by far gave me the best results. It still doesn't really look like rope, but maybe if we put it in game, it will look a lot better. So, I exported it as a PNG and put it side by side to the original. There's a certain look that these upscaling models give images and it's really hard to explain. Like I think the technology is pretty amazing nowadays, but there's just something not quite right about it. Anyway, I went back to the textures folder of the game and there is a folder in there called replacements. Basically, everything you put inside here is going to tell the PCs emulator to load that texture. So, I went back to PCSX2 and tick the box load textures. And we just remastered the first texture of the video. This is a pretty big milestone even though we just slapped it into an upscaler. But as you can see, it looks pretty weird. And that's just because I've used the version of the file that is normalized to 100% opacity. So I need to whack it back in Photoshop, set it to 50% opacity, and now it looks a lot more normal. I finished the day feeling pretty confident, and I was ready to tackle the other textures tomorrow. On day five, an idea hit me. That rope texture is a good example of just, you know, a common object. Unlike Kratos himself, devs have probably scanned an actual rope into the game or at least handdrawn one from a reference image. And I've watched a lot of game development type videos where people take pictures of stuff out in the real world and they basically make textures out of them using Photoshop. So, I thought I'd try the same thing. I didn't have any rope like that laying around in my house, but of course, the internet is a thing and it has so many images of different types of rope. And I managed to find one that matched a resemblance of what I wanted. I put it into Photoshop and cut it out so there was just a singular piece of the rope. And then I scaled it correctly. I tried to get it in a way where the actual lines of the rope actually match the original. So this meant flipping the rope and then making sure that it lined up the best I could get it. I then tried to make the colors match as this one was definitely way too light than the original. Once I was happy with it, I put it in game and realized that I had gone a bit overboard here. You see, the original texture is quite flat in comparison. And when you have this much contrast and detail, things tend to stick out a bit too much. There was also little light highlights that were on the original that weren't on this one. So, I tried adding those in Photoshop with just the paintbrush tool. And I'm not going to lie, it looks nice, but it's just not the original. Like, it's so damn hard to get it looking exactly how it did because it's just so high res now and every detail shows. I landed at this final iteration, and I'm still not 100% on it, but I knew I could not be this much of a perfectionist on every texture, otherwise I would definitely not make the deadline. One thing I did have to sort out, though, was the fact that this texture was not seamless. You can actually see where it stops and the new one starts. I'll admit, I completely glossed over the fact that, yeah, textures are repeated and therefore they need to be seamless. So, I put them in Photoshop and tried to figure out the easiest way to do this. And basically, there's a feature in Photoshop that lets you offset the entire canvas to make it repeat like the texture is going to. And then all you have to do is take the really harsh seams that you can see in the middle and make them blend perfectly. Now, what I used to do back in the day was use the spot healing brush and the stamp tool. But nowadays, Photoshop has come so far that you can just highlight the seam and select generative fill. Now, I'll admit I had to go over it twice and it still wasn't perfect. This was just a case where Generative Phil wasn't really understanding how to seamlessly blend these two together. But once I had put it in game, it was actually really, really clean looking. That's where I kind of realized that what you see on Photoshop up close is obviously nothing compared to when you see it in game as you're blowing up these textures super big and in game they're tiny and repeated. So in future I'd keep that in mind. It's also so quick and easy to just keep replacing the textures and you can do it all in real time whilst in game. though, it's not really that much of a problem. I capped off the work here by replacing the floor texture of the boat. And I had noticed that they had reused the same texture here with just some green over it, which is really smart. In the game, this makes the floor look slightly corroded from the weather. Remastering this floor texture was actually really fun. I grabbed a weathered plank texture from online and then basically made it look one to one to the original, even to the point where the plank stops and starts in the same exact position. I then just added a solid color of green over everything, then used the blend if option inside the blending options to make it nicely blend together with the wood grain. I then inverted the layer mask and painted back the bits that I wanted it to show so that all of the planks weren't green. Now, I think in this case, my version was a lot better than what the upscaling did. Upscaling obviously kept every single little detail from the original, but the extra work that I put in detailing all of the corrosion on the planks made my texture stick out as really really whereas the AI was just upscaling, you know, a wood texture with a green blob on it. Looking at them side by side though, it was clear that my green wasn't quite right. So, I changed that in Photoshop to make sure it matched. Now, here I had to make a pretty big decision going forward. One that could either make or break this video. The upscale textures look tremendously close to the original, closer than I could ever get with my skills. It's like as faithful as it can get in terms of line work, but also something's just not quite right with it when you look up close. But then the textures that I could produce are really high-res and super detailed. But the issue is they weren't really so much as a remaster as they were almost a remake. And when you put it like that, you can see why upscaling is favored a lot nowadays when it comes to making fan-made texture packs. You just cannot make a faithful remaster of a game's textures without having the knowhow and skills to pull it off. So, I decided from this point on that I was going to cut corners when necessary in order to make the deadline that I set for myself. And hopefully with this plan going forward, I can make everything look cohesive. And so, I logged off for the day and continued the journey the very next day. I need to get this boat scene done as quickly as possible. So, I went through and did all of the textures here. Some of them by hand, some of them upscaling. I started to really pick up the pace here of texturing this boat scene. I did, however, keep making the same mistake over and over again of exporting everything at 100% opacity. Also, there was a second rope texture that I tried to remake using an image that I found online, but it just looked really bad. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and just put it into the game. And it did look better than it did in Photoshop, but I'm definitely going to have to come back and change this one later. There was some sort of chain that I couldn't really spot inside the scene, but I remade it anyway. I, however, did actually prefer the upscaling version of it, so I went with that. Now, the big textures that I really wanted to take care of were Kattos's weapons. I actually found a high-res version of the weapons online that I was going to replace with this old one. However, there were really noticeable differences in the blade. I'm not sure if I just got the wrong blade here, but I was willing to actually try to make it look like the original. And after about 40 minutes, I was actually pretty happy with the results. It's not perfect by any means, and some of the lines are extremely warped, but I'm pretty proud of it. However, putting it in game got rid of the chains for some reason. It also just looked a little bit too dark and way too metallic, so I upscaled it. And um I'd like the upscaling version more. This is yet another case where I have literally spent almost an hour remaking this texture and then I upscale it in the matter of 5 seconds and I prefer it. I just think the weapon just gets that added little bit of fidelity to it rather than, you know, looking completely different like my version does. One thing that you can easily replace without it looking bad though is the environment textures like we've explored. So I did the same for this rock texture that's in the background of the cliffs. There are a lot of miscellaneous textures here as well, like rainplash effects that I all just upscaled using Gigapixel. Another one that I recreated from scratch was this one that I thought looked like a wooden crate. So, I started retexturing it as a wooden crate, but I would later find out that this is not what this textures used for. After that, I had fully remastered the boat scene. Of course, the only thing missing was himself. I was worried about remastering, so I left it last. But honestly, Gigapixel did such an amazing job here that I did not have to do anything. For the texture that was featuring his face, I tried to use the face recovery tool a little bit within Gigapixel in order to not lose the detail around his beard and his scar on his left eye. I absolutely love the little details that got added to his lower chest after the subscaling. I really tried to handmake stuff like I put it in Photoshop and I really meticulously went through this texture and just tried to pick out anything that maybe I could do. And then I put it in Gigapixel, saw the results, and I just realized that whatever I was going to come up with here was not going to be as good as this. So, I just went with Gigapixel here and saved myself the time and moved on to the next scene. So, in this scene, I want these two statues to be really high-res. And I notic in the background that this crate texture, or what I thought was a crate texture, is actually a piece of the wall. It didn't look too bad, but it was also extremely jarring going from that really high-res texture to the super low res one right underneath it. For now though, I focused on the statue and the floor piece running them through Gigapixel. This required quite a bit of tinkering with the settings. The face recovery tool didn't work here because it wasn't detecting the statue's face. So, this actually took quite a lot of tinkering to get right, but I think I got it pretty good. So, back on the topic of this wall behind the statues, I actually decided to leave the crate texture, but I just wanted to upscale the texture underneath it. So, I grabbed the same piece of wood that I used for the crate texture and just stretched it out so it matched the whole wall. I then adjusted the colors because the colors were a lot lighter on this wall compared to the top part. The results were nice, but like I don't think this is exactly what the original was supposed to look like. At this point, I really worried that I was going in the wrong direction for the game. Maybe I was misinterpreting these textures a lot, and it just was not faithful at all. I left it for now, but I knew that I had to come back to these textures at one point. So, title screen. This was incredibly quick, easy, and also really fun. For the text, it was just a file with all of the different letters laid out, and I grabbed the exact font that they used from online and just replaced everything one by one. This worked amazingly well. And also for the logo, I found a really, really high-res one online that I replaced it for. This one didn't have a stroke or a drop shadow like the original one does, so I added that. I also added my own little flare to the logo as well. Since this was so incredibly fast and easy, at the end of day, I swung back around to the textures on the wall that I was going to look at, and I run the lower wall texture through Gigapixel to see what that would look like. Now, this is way better. I think it really gives off the vibe that it's plywood and I think that's what they were going for. But of course that top section now looks extremely out of place. So I need to upscale that maybe and then it would look coherent. And yeah, I think this is way better than what I did. So I kept it like this. I was basically going at break neck speed at this point. I'd got the hang of everything dumping the textures, replacing them Photoshop Gigapixel. All of it was just coming naturally. And I was doing it so incredibly fast than I ever thought I was going to be able to. I was going so fast, in fact, that on this day, I basically upscaled some other textures that I didn't intend to for this video, just out of pure fun and curiosity, like the boxes that you open in the game, for example, that restored Kattos's health and his ability power. And now they just look incredibly sharp and more modern looking without any artifacts at all. And the final scene that I wanted to work on, the Olympus one, I wanted to try mass upscaling everything here in one swoop to see how fast I can really do it. So, I set everything to upscale to a 2K resolution and set the model to recover. And in a minute or so, this scene now looks incredible. I had at this point basically figured out how to remaster and upscale textures incredibly quick and easy. Now, texturing was not actually the only thing that I wanted to do for this video. I wanted to also add ambient occlusion as well as ray trace global illumination via reshade. But this was where I faced my biggest hurdle yet. You see, PCSX2 doesn't really play nice with ReShade. Firstly, I installed it targeting the Vulcan API, but that just crashed my game completely. I tried multiple different fixes to get this working, but just ended up having to resort to OpenGL. What was weird though is I've got this to work with Vulcan flawlessly before, so I don't know why it's not working now. Also, although OpenGL worked, I couldn't get it to work in full screen. In order to use full screen, I have to load the game itself in full screen from the get- go. I can't load it in windowed and then double click to full screen. That just gets rid of reshade. An annoying workaround, but nothing compared to the hurdle that I had to face next, the depth buffer. As far as I know, Psis X2 has never played nice with ReShade's depth buffer. Without this, we actually can't add ambient occlusion or ray tracing. In simple terms, it basically tells reshade how close and far objects are away, and it uses that data to add the ambient occlusion to the scene. It sucks because in modern games, we use ray tracing where we simulate how light bounces like it does in the real world. But in a game this old, like God of War, that obviously doesn't exist, and there's no ambient occlusion either. Ambient occlusion basically fakes this effect by giving everything slight shadows. And whilst it doesn't look amazing and some people probably don't like it, I think it really adds to older games. And then obviously ray trace global illumination is an obvious one where things that are a 2D texture can now become a light source. So I spent hours, quite literally hours trying to get this to work with no result whatsoever. And at one point there was a glimmer of hope because I got the normals working, but the depth side of it just was never really how it should look. So naturally feeling pretty defeated, I went for a walk in order to come back with a fresh mind in order to try to remaster it in other ways. So in ReShade, changing the levels and the contrast, brightness, and all the other tweaks, I just don't really think they're necessary. All that I did was add the ambient light effect alongside bloom. Now, I made these really, really, really subtle, and I think they just ever so slightly lift the image. I'm someone that hates overdoing reshade effects. I think less is more when it comes to this stuff. But overall, End of Day 9 was pretty sad because I just didn't get to do the lighting or the ambient occlusion. Maybe if we do a video similar like this, we can pick a game that actually uses this so I can tinker around with it. And so, we reach the final day. I basically spent this day just going over everything that I had done and just making sure that I was happy with it. And after a bit of tinkering here and there, I thought that it was time to finally show you my version of a remaster of God of War. Oh my go. Is it perfect? No. But the fact that I did it myself made it all that much more rewarding. I think what I learned from making this video was just how easy it all is nowadays and the fact that any of you watching this video can remaster your childhood games for yourself and they're going to look a whole lot better than what we used to be able to achieve. I had brought one of my favorite childhood games into the modern era with a little bit of Photoshop online tutorials and an upscaling tool. Now, I want to thank my patreons for supporting the channel. YouTube monetization is wildly unreliable nowadays and so Patreon is by far the best way to support what I make here on Retro Renew. And if you're interested in joining, you can do so for just £1 a month by following the link in the description. Also, if you're new here and enjoyed the video, consider subscribing for more renewing of older games. This was a lot of fun to make, so I'm thinking of doing something very similar or maybe even making a guide out of what I've learned here. If you want to see more about texture packs for emulators, then I recommend you watch this video where I explore them and also show you how to get them yourself. See you over there."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY03OM7qfZ4,youtube_transcript,YY03OM7qfZ4,"This is one of those games that might never be perfectly playable on modern machines, and it's not because of the reasons you might think. I've actively avoided this game whenever someone mentions it because I've tried many times in the past to get this to work. This thing is so frustrating. But why is that? The game is actually on Steam, which is a lot better than a lot of other older games. It's also made by Rockstar Games. I mean, they're a legendary company. They wouldn't sell you something broken and unplayable, right? Well, I'm ass sure a lot of you are probably already screaming, ""No, that's not the case."" I mean, they sold us the definitive edition for crying out loud. This company is known for making really, really odd decisions when it comes to some of their more legendary franchises. So, why the neglect on Manhunt? Well, the truth behind it is is that you can pick this game up on Steam for a reasonable $10. And if you do so, Rockstar Games is going to hand you a completely broken and unplayable mess. But the real kicker here is that in its current state on Steam, many of the antipiriracy measures, like this gate here not opening, for example, within the first 5 minutes, this is going to happen to paying customers. And because of all the weird twisted stuff that Rockstar Games have done for this game, it made me want to make this kind of video where instead of renewing an older game and, you know, celebrating it, we actually do it out of spite this time. Alongside that, I also want to explore the gross treatment of fans from Rockstar Games because it gets a whole lot worse than just selling a broken game. But don't worry, I'm not going to treat you like trash like Rockstar Games does to its customers, which is why you should subscribe to help me get to 100K subs. Now, the glue that really sticks all of this together and is going to make this work is by far the Manhunt fixer. As the name implies, this fixes many of the issues such as crashing, this gate not opening, and also much more. It also comes with optional enhancement mods such as MHP and Manhunt plug-in MH, which we'll get into in a little bit. Firstly though, I want to tell you the story on why this fixer is even needed in the first place and what it actually does. The author found something in the game directory called test app.exe. And this is a different executable for the game, one that he suspected was the original 2004 PC retail release. This version when fixed to run on modern hardware actually didn't have the antipiriracy measures. So why does the other executable have them? And to answer this question, we first need to go back all the way to 2004 where in April the group known as Razer 1911 would crack the game. At the time, Windows XP was the thing. Vista wouldn't release until 2006, which meant this crack was fully compatible with XP, but not with Vista or anything higher. And that is very important to note because years later, Rockstar would release the Steam version in January of 2008. And who would have guessed the version did not work on Windows Vista. Coincidence? Maybe. The community found a way to fix this using the hex editor. And I think this is the same fix that the Manhunt fixer uses. This is also the same exact fix that worked on Razer's crack of the game. You see where I'm going with this? Well, nothing was proven just yet, but 2 years had passed and no one really suspected a thing. And on May 2010, someone noticed something a little bit strange. Liam AJ found out that Rockstar had used a cracked version of Max Pane 2 for their Steam release. I mean, the freaking ASI art for a well-known wearers group known as Myth is just sitting there right inside the .exe of the game. So, what did Rockstar do? Well, they pushed out a completely new .exe for the game without any traces of that crack. But for some reason, instead of hiding the evidence, they left the cracked executable in there. And guess what? They renamed it to test app.exe. I wanted to see for myself. And well, yeah, even till this day, if you download Maxpane 2, there will in fact be a test app.exe in there. And inside the hex editor, the myth Asia is right there. Why their sneaky cover up of this for Max Pane 2 matters though is because, well, at this point, the cat was out of the bag. So Rockstar Games was obviously a little bit panicky here because they knew fans were on to something and well they didn't want anyone digging up their skeletons. And only 9 days after they release an update for Manhunt, not bringing any new content or anything like that, they simply make a new .exe and then rename the old one test app.exe. And so people quickly looked into it and realized that yeah, this has a Razer 1991 mark inside it, which means this has been a pirated version this whole time as well. You might be wondering though, if the old one is cracked, is the new one that they put in place? Actually, no. And that's what makes this one actually worse. This new executable doesn't check if the disc is in your PC like the original disc copies do. They either found an executable that didn't have the checks or applied a patch to ignore it. But what it looks like they did was boot the game up, realized that it didn't check for the disc and that it ran, and then just shipped it to Steam. But they clearly did not play it for literally 5 minutes because if they did so, they would know that you're soft locked. You cannot enter this gate. But players, you know, the ones that actually play the games, quickly pointed out all of the bugs. There was so many reports of crashing and not getting past the gate and other softlocked issues. People quickly found out that yes, these are antipiriracy measures because Rockstar not only did not bother to test it, but also didn't bypass their own crack protection. What's even crazier is now we're at a point where we're over 15 years later now, and nothing has changed. It's still in this broken state and fully available to purchase. This whole thing literally makes me so mad because people don't trust game companies nowadays. And this kind of proves that they really shouldn't. This is a company that goes out of their way to shut down passion projects like reverse engineering GTA 3 and Vice City. They shut down those projects to keep these older games alive whilst literally doing nothing at all to keep their own games alive. The reason the community are doing things like this is because you're not doing it. So, what does this all mean for getting the game to work? Well, with all of this in mind, we now know that the secret to getting the game to work is via the Manhunt fixer. Because what the creator has done here is just completely disregard that lazy updated exe that Rockstar pushed out and focused on the test app fix they left behind. So, this allows the game to work on modern Windows machines and play the game without any of the antipiriracy stuff. So, the best way to play Manhunt today is to use the pirated cracked executable that Rockstar themselves gave you. I still cannot believe this is all real. Manhunt Fixer is an automated tool that is really easy to install. And when you do so, it's going to fix a few things like the executable not launching at all, various AI errors and scripts not executing properly achieved by limiting the frame rate to 60, also fixing a bunch of the end level crashes and the audio and music looping. It's got a menu to easily choose what you want and it works with the Steam and also retail release of the game. It also comes with a variety of optional enhancements that you might want to consider like widescreen front-end textures which are rescaled and blurred. MHP is also really recommended because it improves the renderer by completely rewriting it. Besides enhancing the look of the game, it also takes back some of the things that are in the PS2 release that are not on the PC one. There's also PS2 cache texture if you want to take it a bit further and make it more like the PS2 release. This replaces it with the PS2 model. And some people might like the extra details that this one has over the PC, but it's entirely subjective. There's also fix global models, which fixes rats and crows being completely pitch black. It also fixes some smaller transparent models on the maps. There's also some novelty things like the Discord plugin, which will show your game activity and how many kills you have and your health and stuff. More importantly though, plugin MH is a big one. This adds a lot of features. It includes access to the original developer menu, custom menu, console, firstperson mode, simple mod loader, and much, much more. Because it only adds extra things like that though, I wouldn't recommend it as someone that wants a base experience. If you want an absolutely stock experience, my recommendation would be to get MHP and fix global textures. Those are the only two that you're going to need to fix the game. Because the manhunt fixer also applies a widescreen fix, you can put this ini file just called windowed mode in the path of the game. And that's going to make it run in windowed as well if you want that. You might also have issues using controller with this game like I did because a lot of the Xinput controllers, for example, have the complete wrong mappings and are practically unusable. Apparently, you can use something called Xinput Plus, but you can also try using Steam Input to figure this out. Besides that though, it's weird that I'm saying that this game is so broken, but just one simple thing fixes it. But it's just it's not going to be perfect, if that makes sense. You're not going to have a super smooth experience here. There are things that you can layer on top of this. Stuff like Manhunt Remastered, which adds 60 fps FMVs and upscales the textures. There's also Blood Moon Manhunt, which again adds higher quality textures. Also, Project Cara, which adds beta content, more gore execution/ new cams, which as the name implies, adds more of those features. Improved effects improves the muzzle flashes, for example, for guns. There's also even an RTX Remix mod for Manhunt that adds full path trace lighting and PBR textures to the game. and it does look pretty good. I think the problem is though, a lot of these RTX Remix things just have so many different things about them that just aren't quite right yet. But I think, you know, given a little bit of improvement over the next few years will actually make these super super cool to try out. For now though, I just like to keep things basic. I think getting the game to just work with Manhunt fixer and then making sure to cap the FPS to 60 in order to not avoid any issues, which the Manhunt fixer should do itself, but I like to just double check and make sure that Reva Tuna is setting it to 60 as well, just to be sure. For me personally, I'm a Steam snob, so to play this game on Steam is kind of the ideal way for me to experience it. But I have to say, I tried out the game running on the PCSX2 emulator, which is the original release of the game. This was originally made for just the PlayStation 2. It was then released on PC and Xbox, I think a year later. But the fact that we can get it running pretty perfectly on the PCX emulator on your PC, I would say that if you actually want the best, most authentic experience, this is by far the way to go. It is so smooth. There's widescreen. There's also a 60fps patch, so you can get the exact same frame rates as PC because remember, you have to lock PC frame rates in order to not break the game. And then on top of that, you can crank the resolutions to 4K and, you know, try some extra effects as well if you like. Maybe even add some textures. There are some upscale textures out there you can try. Again, for me personally, I just prefer it on Steam, so I'm willing to put up with the issues. But if you want the most issue-free experience, definitely go for PCSX2, especially cuz controllers just work right out of the gate with that version. No tinkering needed. Another thing I think is worth noting is the noise effects. Now, this is purely personal preference, but I just want to kind of give my take on this. The thing is on the PS2 version, if you run it at native PS2 resolution and stock settings, you'll find that the noise effect is really, really atmospheric. And I think it's the best way to experience this game. But if you crank the internal resolution on PCSX2 or you play on PC at high modern resolutions, the noise effect is terrible. it is so over the top and just makes the image look really really weird because you've got this super blurry noise effect on top of a super clear crystal image. So for me, if I was going to play it at the highest resolutions possible, I would definitely turn off the noise. But if I want the ultimate authentic Manhunt experience, it's got to be playing on PCSX2, switching to software renderer to be honest, which means that it's not using your graphics card to render the image, but it's almost perfect emulation to the PS2, which means you don't get to turn up the internal resolutions or do any fancy stuff, but that's why it's so cool, especially for a game this dark and gritty and atmospheric. It is actually incredible to play it like this. Honestly though, it's just about having options. that you have all these options. Now, with Manhunt Fixer, you technically do have PC. No, it's not perfect. It's really like stuttery feeling and kind of clunky compared to the P6X2, but we have options here and that's really what matters. So, the community once again has kind of um pulled their weight and done a whole lot more than what Rockstar will probably ever do. To be honest, I have no faith in Rockstar at this point. I can't really stress enough how much the community does for all of these older games. And to be honest, this channel wouldn't even exist without the work that all of these dedicated fans do to bring these games back to life. And if you want to see more of that kind of stuff, then I think you should check out this video on screen right now. See you over there."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j7F-e-sels,youtube_transcript,7j7F-e-sels,"If you're looking for an up-to-date guide to enhance your experience with Twilight Princess, this is most certainly the one you want to follow. Of course, the game was released on Wii U as well, but today I'm going to focus on the Gamecube version running on Dolphin. I could have gone with the Wii version as well, but it's essentially the same game with motion controls. Just a heads up before continuing, the texture pack I use to enhance Twilight Princess is not free, but I will direct you guys to a free texture pack that's a reasonable substitute, but obviously the paid one is better. [music] So, with that out of the way, let's start with this easy guide. Let's download Dolphin first. If you're familiar with this step, just skip forward to another segment. But if you're still new to Gamecube emulation, please pay close attention. Most of you will be on Windows, so just copy what I do. Once that's done, I recommend moving the downloaded archive to your desktop. It makes things a bit more manageable. [music] From there, we can install Dolphin to the computer. We'll just open the archive and extract the folder into the C drive. You [music] don't have to do it this way, but I'm just trying to keep things simple. After that, we can close the extraction tool [music] and delete the Dolphin archive since we no longer need it. Before running Dolphin for the first time, we should set it into portable mode. Just create a text [music] file called portable.txt. If you already have settings configured, [music] be warned that this will set everything back to default and your save files will also be gone. So, be careful before turning on portable mode. But if this is your first time running Dolphin, it's perfectly fine to [music] use portable mode. By the way, you'll notice a user folder here, which was created when I ran Dolphin for the first time. It's this user folder that's important for the installation of texture packs. And without implementing portable mode first, [music] this would have been much harder to find on your PC. All right, so let's start configuring Dolphin for default settings. This will essentially be a baseline for all GameCube and Wii [music] games running on the emulator. Later on, I will show you how to change [music] settings specifically for Twilight Princess. I forgot to enable cheats here, as I should have, but I will do it a bit later in this video. Under the graphics tab, [music] there are a few things to change. Just follow my example. 1080p is a good general resolution for most games running on Dolphin. You could push it all the way up to 4K, but unless you're installing texture [music] packs, it's not really necessary. Before moving on to controls, we should have a look at the advanced tab. Texture packs won't work unless this setting is activated here. Prefetch works with about 90% of texture packs, but a few, like the HD mod for Resident Evil 4, won't [music] work with this enabled, so always test the setting. Since we're going to run the GameCube version of Twilight Princess, we'll just configure the Gamecube controls. I own an Xbox 360 pad, but if you use something else like a PS4 controller, the option should be available in the drop- down menu. Anyway, proceed to map the buttons when you're ready. And when that's [music] done, go ahead and save the profile. Call it whatever you like and simply click the save button. Under the interface tab, there are only two [music] things to change. The first is to allow the downloading of game covers to dolphin. And the second is to change mouse cursor visibility to never. [music] The mouse cursor will just be a nuisance when you're playing games. With paths, you can direct Dolphin to wherever your games are installed. I usually like to keep games inside Dolphin's main folder because it makes it easier to find, but the choice is yours. If you look here, you'll notice that I have a GameCube ROM of Twilight [music] Princess. It's an ISO image file. And if I drag it inside the emulator's main folder, the game will suddenly become visible inside the [music] view screen. It's in the list view, but if I change to grid view, you'll see that we have the game's proper box art. Now, you understand why we enabled the downloading of game covers. In case you didn't know, the game is ready to be played. It will already look a lot better than the [music] standard GameCube version. But if you're interested in even better graphics, maybe you should continue watching. All right, if you're interested in going further, first make sure that your game is in the ISO format. It might be [music] something else like RVZ. And if it is, Dolphin has a built-in tool to convert files to ISO, so use [music] it if required. The tool will not delete the original file, but simply make a new one as an ISO. So direct the tool to wherever your game folder is and click [music] the save button. Now it's time to download the texture pack. The one I'm installing was made by Henrio Magnico, but like I said earlier, there is [music] a free alternative if you don't want to spend money. I'll give download links to both, so don't worry. So once you've downloaded your texture pack of [music] choice, simply extract it to your desktop. It all looks very complicated to the untrained [music] eye, but we're not going to use most of the files and folders here. This texture pack includes a version of Dolphin that's way too old. [music] So, we'll just skip it and head over to this folder here. This is the actual texture pack, [music] and it's what we really want. We're going to move this inside Dolphin. So, go ahead and cut this folder. It will go to the textures folder inside Dolphin. So, if you don't know where it is, just keep following my example. Before continuing, we need to [music] make sure it's labeled correctly. The serial needs to match the one given to Twilight Princess inside Dolphin. So, just follow my example if [music] you're clueless. This is the correct serial for the US NTSC version of Twilight Princess. You need to take note and then replicate it here on the folder. Make sure the serials match. The only thing left is to configure Twilight Princess for its [music] texture pack. You start by right-clicking on its profile and selecting properties. Go to game config and then graphics. First, change the aspect ratio to 16x9 and [music] then under enhancements, crank the resolution all the way to 4K. This is to take full advantage of the texture pack. The next setting to activate is arbitrary MIPM mapap detection. It's used to fix broken sun rays which are mostly visible through windows. After that, you need to head over to the patches tab and enable the high rule field speed hack. The last thing we need to cover are the gecko codes. The widescreen hack is already available here and we [music] should just activate it. But you can see that Dolphin wants me to enable cheats first. Without cheats, [music] none of the hacks will work. There is another Gecko code that we have to add [music] manually, and this one is meant to mitigate the bleeding or ghosting effect of Bloom in the game's graphics. Bloom [music] is quite strong, so this is an important fix. Once you found it, [music] simply highlight the entire code and then copy it like so. And [music] after that, go back to Dolphin and go back to its properties. From there, go to the gecko codes [music] again and create the custom code as shown here. Twilight Princess is finally ready to be played with upscaled graphics and [music] enhanced textures. I hope you appreciated this guide because it was quite a chore. But anyway, if you found it useful, please remember to give a like. Thanks for watching and have a nice"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiuNUlBz6yQ,youtube_transcript,SiuNUlBz6yQ,Final Fantasy 10 is almost a quarter of a century old now so how well is it emulated on a PC and how well does it compare to the PS3 Steam and switch versions on their respective emulators let's find out the PS2 version is emulated on pcsx2 off course and the good news is that both X1 and X2 have texture packs if you're interested I'll leave links for your convenience but do they dramatically improve the visuals it's not a dramatic Improvement focusing mostly on some terrain and character models it helps to make some textures a little bit sharper though I noticed three issues while playing on pcsx2 firstly the UI elements look really bad even for a PS2 game the emulator tries its best to smooth the text but it doesn't always work the second issue are cinematics which don't seem to align properly on x2 they seem to be offset somewhat and I don't know if it was intentional but it looks wrong and lastly the widescreen hack can sometimes exposed geometry That was supposed to be hidden by letter boxes Final Fantasy 10 was first remastered on the verer and PS3 I couldn't get the game to work on VA 3K but it runs well on rpcs3 and I'll just say from the outset that it looks far superior to pcsx2 even with the texture packs installed [Music] the onscreen Hut elements have also been vastly improved the text no longer looks so pixelated and overall things just look a lot cleaner and sharper sound has also been enhanced for the remaster listen for yourself listen to my story this may be our last [Music] chance listen to my story this may be our last chance there are two issues that I noticed though despite the fact that I had vsync enabled the cinematics still had screen tearing it isn't terrible but it is distracting and secondly I noticed a few minor glitches with character shadows I don't know if this is due to emulation but it is noticeable in 2016 the game was ported to Steam and it was very well received it came with all of the PS3 versions bonus material included like eternal Calm which was a cinematic that explained events between X1 and X2 last mission was a standalone Quest that played like a Rog likee the main advantage of the steam version is its modding Community there are texture enhancements if you're interested in improving the graphics further but for me it already looked decent enough the only Tri I have is the lack of quick saves which is ironic because this can easily be done in pcsx2 but apparently it's not possible in a PC game conversely this is the only version where you can skip cinematics which is a godsend for people doing their second or third playthroughs I used Ryu jinkx to emulate the switch version it's very similar to the game on PC almost to a fault I'll show a few comparisons just to prove my point the switch version is a bit sharper maybe but that could be due to my emulator settings [Music] [Music] anyway that's it for this video if you found it useful please remember to give a like it really helps with the algorithm thanks for watching and have a nice day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IBDG_GJKFw,youtube_transcript,6IBDG_GJKFw,after making my Resident Evil 4 video recently I realized that I had never made a proper guide on how to install texture packs for Dolphin It's relatively simple but easy to mess up if you don't know what you're doing the least challenging part is finding texture packs Google will serve you well and there is a forum where most texture packs are located however be aware that some are available in two formats for example with Mario Kart Double Dash you can see there's PNG and DDS formats as far as I understand DDS is better for performance and should be your Preferred Choice installing texture packs takes a few steps but it's not difficult to follow go into the dolphin folder and create a text file called portable. txt you only have to do this once this switches dolphin into portable mode which is what we want now run the emulator to transfer the user files inside its main folder [Music] now we will extract the texture pack into the relevant folder take note of what I do both GameCube and Wii texture packs go into this folder this is the correct folder because the name matches up with the one in the game's properties let me show you once that is done we can just enable texture packs inside dolphin itself go to graphics and then the advanced tab from there click on load textures if it's not activated this particular texture pack for Resident Evil 4 doesn't work when prefetch is activated and it happens with ocara of time as well but I found that it can be turned on with about 90% of texture packs don't be afraid to experiment though you can configure the emulator while games are running so it's easy to see how changing settings affect Graphics anyway if you found this useful please remember to give a like it really helps with the algorithm thanks for watching and have a nice day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGeLqcwAjws,youtube_transcript,UGeLqcwAjws,"In this video, I'm going to be breaking down and explaining every single graphics option for PCSX 2, but more importantly, showing you what they actually look like with sideby-side examples. So, by the end of the video, you'll know what you're setting, why you're setting it, and if you should be setting it in the first place. Since the last video, I've learned a lot more about this emulator, and as a result, a bunch of advice has changed. We're also going much more in depth with everything, but in particular, anti-aliasing, which is where most people tend to go wrong with PCSX, too. Also, thanks to the harassment from yours truly, we now have a new option to play around with. Gamma adjustment was absolutely needed. And of course, I'm going to tell you all about it when we hit post-processing. So, let's just get into it. So, we're going to start at the top with graphics renderers. And out of all of these, there is a clear winner, and that is most definitely Vulcan. It's accurate and it performs the best. But, you may not have the hardware to be able to run this one. In which case, you can use OpenGL or Direct 3D11 instead. OpenGL is the most accurate hardware renderer you can use, but it may not perform the best. Whereas Direct 3D11 is the most inaccurate one you can use, but its performance is pretty good. So with these two, it's just a case of picky poison. Now software of course is not a hardware renderer because all rendering is taking place by your CPU in software and for reasons it makes it the most accurate option you can use. So if emulation accuracy and keeping the image true to the original is your main concern, software renderer is the one for you. Do keep in mind when you select it, you lose access to the majority of the rendering options because there's no hardware acceleration, essentially locking you to everything the PlayStation 2 originally used. But you can still use the display options with it to make it look appropriate for a digital display. Null at the bottom is for debugging only and doesn't even display an image. So just ignore this one. Now, I fully recommend you go with Vulcan by default if you got it, but if you're unsure, just go with automatic with adapter. actually select your main GPU so you're not leaving anything a chance. So, we're going to move on to the rendering options instead of the display stuff because it makes more sense to. Now, increasing the internal resolution will cram in all of those additional pixels for whichever resolution you set. As always, when upscaling, it's recommended to set this to your screen resolution as going beyond it is for the most part overkill. There is a misconception that setting this beyond your screen resolution on its own is going to apply anti-aliasing. However, this is just not the case. So, if you take a look at the bottom of this box at 1080, we've got a bunch of jaggies. And even if I set this all the way to 8K, as you can see, those jaggies remain. We are adding those additional pixels, but no proper anti-aliasing. And I'll be covering proper AA once we hit that section. So, for the moment, keep this to your screen resolution. Now, to save on the PS2's resources, back in the day, most 3D textures were made like this. Then, the PS2's bilinear hardware filtering was applied to smooth everything out and remove the blockiness. However, not all textures got filtering. Quite often, 2D textures or even entire 2D games didn't have any filtering applied at all. And ultimately, it was the game devs that chose which textures got filtering and which ones did not. But with this option, we can override what they've done and decide what gets filtering ourselves. So, by linear PS2 is the default and it's applying exactly what the devs applied. You want to keep it as default as it doesn't break anything. Now setting nearest isn't using any filtering and shows these textures own natural rail. There isn't really any reason to use this with 3D games as it reveals the blockiness. However, if you want razor sharp pixels in pure 2D games that are using bilinear, this may be an option to remove it if it doesn't break any rendering. Now, setting bilinear forced would apply to all textures, including the ones the devs didn't apply it to. This comes in handy if you want to smooth out 2D assets and games that don't have any filtering whatsoever. But again, watch out. It doesn't break anything. The exclude sprite variant of this does exactly the same thing, only it won't apply to the 2D sprites. But the tricky thing is what you think is a sprite sometimes isn't, and vice versa. So if you want bilinear for all the 3D stuff, but none of the 2D stuff, this may or may not exclude all the sprites and 2D content you want it to. So just keep an eye out. And again, this can break rendering. Now, some games also utilize trilinear filtering, which is essentially using midm maps to calculate smoothing gradients to textures that are going to be viewed at extreme angles. For example, this track in Jack Combat Racing. This allowed devs to apply smoothing to the textures that are in the distance and have them become sharper the closer they get to the point of perspective with a smooth gradient between the two, which in turn creates a depth of field effect. At the time with CRTs, this was the pinnacle. But on digital displays, especially at high resolutions, it can look quite blurry. But with this trilinear filtering option, we can turn it off, which as you can see significantly sharpens all those textures as we're removing trilinear filtering entirely, only leaving the bilinear underneath. Of course, we're getting rid of that depth of field effect and emulation accuracy. So, it definitely comes down to personal preference if you want to keep it in or get rid of it. But do keep in mind getting rid of it can break stuff. Now, it is pretty tricky to identify if your game is using trilinear filtering. So, a pro tip is to turn bilinear filtering off entirely with nearest. And if you notice any texture blurring whatsoever, you know that it's only due to trilinear. And if I turn trilinear off at the same time as bilinear, as you can see, we are now just looking at raw textures. Forcing trilinear applies it to every texture and replaces any bilinear texture filtering. For most games that only use bilinear, it's hard to tell the difference with trilinear instead, especially the games that don't even have MI maps in the first place, to which there are a few, and this is all but useless for. However, where this is useful is for games that have already had Triilinear implemented, just not as well as it could have been because of the PS2's hardware limitations. And a really good example of this is Burnout 3. As you can see, the smoothing gradients are not consistent. You can see the line where the devs have set trial linear to end and we got sharp patches in the distance where there really shouldn't be. And the reason they didn't apply trilinear to the entire road texture is because of those hardware limitations pushing them to use it sparingly in the way that you see here. But because this is emulation, we are not restricted by the PS2's performance. So we can just go ahead and force trilinear to every single texture in the way they couldn't. And as you can see, we now have much more consistent gradients that arguably look better than the original. And looking at this, the penny should drop as to what it actually does. You for sure want to leave both of these at default and only change them if you feel the need to, which to be honest, I generally don't. Only if I'm super focused on a game will I see if anything else looks any better. But for the most part, using what the dev set doesn't break anything, easiest to use, and looks the best. Now, anotropic filtering with most emulators and PC games is used to make textures look sharper when they're being viewed at extreme angles. But with PCSX2, that is not its main function. With this emulator, it's mostly used to get rid of texture aliasing at extreme viewing angles, which does help with anti-aliasing as a whole. And the nice thing with this, it's not that performance costly, so time 16 should be okay for the majority. Dithering is mostly an old school technique intended for CRTs. It applies a dithering pattern to textures that helps smooth over color banding and gradients. One downside to this on digital displays though, the dithering pattern is actually visible and it would have normally been hidden by the scan lines and mask of a CRT. But with this option, we got two ways to get rid of it and two ways to display it. So scaled will scale the dithering along with your internal resolution. So those tiny squares increase in size as you up the internal res. With this one, you can see the dithering pattern the most. Unscaled displays those squares at their native resolution irrespective of your internal res. In other words, they stay the same size as you increase your resolution. This is best if you're upscaling and retaining the dithering as those squares will be smaller and harder to see as you increase your resolution, but still doing their job of removing the color banding. Now, turning this off disables dithering entirely, which does remove the pattern, but it does also reveal the color banding dithering is actively removing. Then we have 32bit, which removes the dithering pattern and the banding, getting the best of both worlds. However, it can break stuff, mainly shadows. So, where this is really the best for digital displays, you need to try it per game to see if it breaks anything. My recommendation is to leave it on unscaleed by default and try 32-bit per game. But if 32-bit doesn't work, you can just use off. If you're okay trading the dithering pattern for color banding instead, do keep in mind not all games even have dithering in the first place. And for those games, you want to keep it on unscaled. Now, we can move on to blending accuracy. So, some games shader blending needs a bit more power to render in certain textures accurately. By default, this is set to basic as it's kind performance, but if you launch a game that requires a higher setting, it will tell you exactly what it needs on boot, but it won't change it for you. The higher the setting, the more demanding it is. If you're on really good hardware, you can set this to full or maximum to save you the job having to change it per game all the time. But if you're on lower-end hardware, set it to basic and only change it when prompted. If you can't run the game at full speed with the recommended setting, you need to drop it back or find performance elsewhere. So, moving on to the display options and full screen mode is nice and easy. Just leave it on borderless full screen. With the aspect ratios, I need to cover 4x3 and widescreen separately. So, auto standard will set 4x3 if the emulator detects an interlaced image. But if it detects a progressive scan image, it will automatically apply the slightly wider 3x2. Standard 4x3 will simply set 4x3 irrespective of the image type it detects. And you want to use this if those 3x2 progressive games come out slightly too wide. With widescreen, there's a couple of ways to do it. You can just stretch the image using fit window, but to be honest, this looks horrific. Instead, it's much better to present a proper anamorphic image, meaning all that extra stuff is actually being rendered in on sides. The best way to do this is just to play a game that natively supports widescreen. The PS2 came out just before we transitioned to 16x9 as standard. And there may be more native widecreen games out there than you initially thought, and I'll put a link for a list of these in the description below. Just remember to set 16x9 here, then go into the actual in-game options and set 16x9 there. For games that don't natively support widescreen, you can check to see if it's got a widescreen patch instead, which is essentially hacking widescreen. And to check this, all you need to do is find the game in the games list, right click on it, and go into properties. then go into patches on the lefth hand side and if it's got one you should see it playing as day. There's two different ways that you can turn this on per game right here in the properties. Alternatively, if you wanted to apply them automatically to every game that's got one and turn them on, you can apply widecreen patches here rather than having to do it per game. Again, don't forget to set 16x9 when using widescreen patches. Now, you can force FMVs only into any aspect ratio that you want. But the only reason I tend to use this is when I'm using widescreen because when you're using widescreen, nine times out of 10, the FMVs are going to be stretched. And I prefer these in 4x3 or whatever's correct for the game. Now, the vast majority of PS2 games use interlacing. This was another old school technique mostly intended for CRTs. It uses two separate fields of lines and alternates between the two really fast to present the image, which is what causes this to happen on digital displays. But we can get rid of these lines in three different ways. Firstly, there are games that natively support progressive scan, and I'll put a link for a list of these in the description below. Just remember to set progressive scan in their actual in-game options if it's not active by default. If a game doesn't natively support progressive, you can check to see if it's got a no interlacing patch instead, which is hacking/forcing progressive into the game. So, right click on your game in the games list, go into properties, then go into patches on the left hand side, and if it's got one, you should see it. And just like the widescreen patches, you can either turn them on per game right here. Alternatively, if you want to turn them on automatically for all games that have them, you can apply no interlacing patches in the main options, which I fully recommend that you do if you're using a digital display. Now, there are still loads of games that don't have native progressive support or a no interlacing patch. And for those, we can use this de-inacing option, which is using one of these algorithms to merge those interlacing lines. Automatic is definitely the best one to use by default as for the most part the emulator knows which one is best. But you may find a game where auto doesn't quite do the job, in which case you'll need to try one of the others. Sometimes at high resolutions, no deacing can work the best if auto doesn't. But a pro tip, you can press F5 with the game actually running to cycle through these, making it really easy to find the one that removes the lines the best. If you've cycled your way through these and still can't get rid of those lines, activate disable interlace offset and go through them again and hopefully you should find a winner. Now, this bilinear filtering option is not to be confused with bilinear texture filtering. Of course, this is only been applied to the textures, whereas this is being applied to the entire image on output. This is used to slightly refine the image to make it look a little bit nicer for digital displays. You're going to notice this more at lower resolutions because at higher ones, its effects are much more subtle. So, none of isn't using any filtering, and it will give you the sharpest possible image. For myself, I'll set this for pure 2D games for razor sharp pixels. For 3D games, I'll always use bilinear smooth because it's removing those harsh edges off of those pixels, which does go some way to helping with anti-aliasing. Yes, it is slightly softening the image, but that, in my opinion, is actually a benefit. And for some games, this needs to be set, otherwise you're going to see the texture blockiness underneath. Bilinear sharp is kind of an outlier here and you want to use it if you want something between none and smooth. Vertical stretch comes in handy when you're using widescreen because sometimes the image can turn out a little bit vertically stretched or squashed. And obviously with this option you can fix that. Another weird CRT thing the PS2 used to do was intentional blurring. This looked just fine on CRTs, but on digital displays again it looks absolutely horrific. Not all games used it, but for the ones that do, we've got two ways to remove it. The first and best way is with game patches. So again, right click on your game, go into properties, then go into patches, and if it's got one, you should see it. Now, unlike the interlacing and widescreen patches, there is no way to automatically turn these on. So you can only do it per game. This anti-blur option is completely separate to patches, so don't think it's going to turn them on in any way, shape, or form. This is simply deploying the emulator's internal solution. This is on by default out of the box as it doesn't really break anything and you can keep it on by default even if you're using a per game patch. Generally using patches is better than this option but it has come on leaps and bounds recently to the point where you might not even find yourself reaching for a patch. Integer scaling will scale the image in integers which is technically more accurate but it can reduce the viewport size. So personally I tend to stay away from it and it's really one for the OCD math nerds. Screen offsets is way too complicated to get into. So to keep it simple, if you see this kind of issue, you need to turn it on. To show the overscan area, screen offsets also needs to be active. But I think that pretty much every single PS2 game just has black bars in the overscan area, meaning there's no practical reason to display it. So just keep it off by default. Now, we can move on to post-processing and proper anti-aliasing. There's two different ways to do it, both pretty nuanced, and we're going to start with FXA. Now FXA is an often bash form of anti-aliasing. However, its effectiveness is only ever as good as its implementation. And with PCSX2, it's actually pretty good. However, its effectiveness can drop off at higher resolutions, which tends to be around about the 4K mark. So, 4K and above, it is going to take an effect, but you're still going to have a few jaggies remaining. The other way to apply anti-aliasing is to use one of these downsampling shaders at the bottom here. And inversely, these work better at high resolutions than they do lower ones. So, if I select this 4G RGSS1 at 1080, it is doing a good job, but it's not completely removing the jaggies. However, if I increase my internal resolution all the way up to 4K, as you can see, it's doing a much better job. And the higher you set your internal resolution with downsampling, the more anti-aliasing will be applied. So, at 12x, it pretty much completely removes all of the jaggies entirely. So, realistically, it's FXA up to about 4x and 4K and up, you should be using downsampling. But there's nothing to say that you can't use both at the same time for even more anti-aliasing irrespective of your internal resolution. So recently I submitted a request to the PCSX2 GitHub to add gamma control to shade boost as it was definitely needed. And not only did they take me up on my suggestion, they had it done in no time. So thanks to the PCSX2 team for taking this one on. Now Shade Boost as a whole is here to adjust monitor settings without actually adjusting your physical monitor. This is needed thanks to the variance of analog hardware back in the day because the game's default brightness, contrast, and saturation back then were mostly an estimation by the game devs because 10% brightness, for example, with one TV manufacturer may be more akin to 15% brightness with a different manufacturer. Same for contrast and the other settings. So devs would have done the best they can to get it looking correct for everyone, but there is no accounting for analog variance. As a result, some games at default may look just fine and others are going to look incorrect with their brightness, contrast, etc. The best example of this is Metal Gear Solid 3. As you can see in this scale, everything under the orange line is meant to be black, but we can actually see it, which is why this game looks totally washed out. Now, even though this is telling us to adjust our monitor brightness, it's not really the brightness we need to adjust because of the differences between analog and digital hardware. Simply lowering the brightness doesn't really get rid of those gradients. And at the point it does, it is just way too dark. So instead, we need to adjust the contrast, gamma, and brightness in conjunction to get the result that we want. For this game in particular, the first thing I'll do is increase the contrast up to 56, which, as you can see, gets rid of those two bottom gradients, which is what the devs intended. And increasing the contrast specifically is what is going to remove that washed out, foggy, hazy kind of thing that you can get with a lot of PS2 games. However, by increasing the contrast, we've made the midtones darker and the highlights brighter to the point where they're blowing out and losing detail. And before gamma control, the only way to fix either of these was with brightness. The downside to this though is that if you were to decrease this, so those highlights are no longer blown out, those midtones become even darker. And inversely, if you were to increase it, so those mid tones are actually correct, those highlights become even more blown out, meaning you had to find a compromise. And this is the entire reason I requested gamma control because gamma in lay terms will only adjust the midtones. Think of it as you're only adjusting the darker stuff in the image, allowing us to increase the brightness in those darker midtone areas without blowing out the stuff that's already bright. Effectively giving us control over the midtones and the highlights independently, meaning we don't have to compromise. So with MGS3, we can get rid of the washed out look by increasing the contrast. And with the blown out highlights, we can fix those by decreasing the brightness down to 46. And with the mid tones that are too low, we can increase those with gamma up to 57. Now, it kind of goes without saying that what you need to set here is going to vary game to game. And beyond getting it correct in the brightness calibration, it also comes down to personal preference, especially when it comes to saturation, which for this game I do like to bump up to 52. So, here's the before and here's the after. Much, much better, which is why shade boost is so important. and shouldn't be ignored. But for the most part, I recommend that you keep it off and only change it if you notice the game looks completely washed out or incorrect with its brightness and contrast. Now, contrast adaptive sharpening will add additional sharpening to the entire image. And for the most part, I recommend you sharpen and resize for the display resolution, and you can choose how sharp you make it on the right hand side. And this is another one you're going to notice more at lower resolutions than you are at higher ones. And as you can see, if I crank this up at 1080 all the way to 100%, it's revealing the texture blockiness underneath and it's also revealing those sharp texture edges. However, something I came across completely by chance is that if you use one of the downsampling shaders with it, it completely mitigates those issues. So, we get to enjoy 100% sharpness without any of the downsides. Again, this is one you want to keep off by default and only set it up per game as how it looks is completely dependent on the game's graphics. And you don't really want to be using this with just pure 2D games. Now, we've been through all the graphics options. I do just want to quickly cover latency control and frame pacing in the emulation options. Now, VSYNC you'll need to activate to get rid of the screen tearing, which is pretty much guaranteed to happen, especially at higher resolutions. PCSXT's frame pacing straight out of the box is actually really, really good. So, activating optimal frame pacing isn't really going to have too much of an impact on your actual frame pacing. However, what it does do is reduce your input latency, which is one of the major complaints with this emulator. But using this is hugely costly on your performance. So, make sure that you got the headroom to be able to use it. Now, PS2 games natively run just slightly slower than 60 Hz. And if you're using a 60 Hz monitor, that difference can cause micro stutter. But sync to host refresh rate is here to fix that issue. It allows the emulation speed to run over by up to 1% which will bridge the gap between the two, which should remove that micro stutter. When it comes to setting your defaults, of course, just set it up to your preference. But if you want to copy what I do, here's what I've got set for my display rendering and post-processing tabs. But I set all of this up in the knowledge I'm going to be changing a lot of it per game. And don't forget, you can change everything that we've covered in this video on a per game basis. So with the game actually running, you want to go into settings in the top lefthand corner and click on game properties. Then come down to graphics on the lefth hand side. And as you can see, we have all of those exact same options. And anything that you change here will be done for this game specifically and will not mess around with the global defaults. So hopefully this updated video has answered any questions you might have about these settings. And if it didn't, let me know in the comments below and I'll do my best to help you out. But if it did help you out, slam it a like. And if you want to keep up to date with any future guides, you know what to do. And if you want to help out with the channel, check out the Patreon link in the description below. And apart from that, go play some games. Adios."

    The Dolphin Blog is full of stories surrounding games, their development, and the challenges they present to emulate them. And in these stories, we sometimes have some recurring characters that we gain a better understanding of over time. Factor 5 and their Star Wars: Rogue Squadron games continue to amaze us time and time again as we find different ways that they push the hardware to its limits. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker uses many graphical tricks to create a timeless style, that surprises again and again …

Learn more









Available on
RetroArch is available for download on a wide variety of app store platforms.
NOTE: Functionality can sometimes be different from that of the version available for download on our website. We sometimes have to conform to certain restrictions and standards that the app store platform provider imposes on us.











Cores
RetroArch/Libretro has over 200 cores, and the list keeps expanding over time. These include game engines, games, multimedia programs and emulators.



















OpenLara
OpenLara is an early Tomb Raider game engine recreation.
Core available now for Windows/Linux.
For more information, read our article on this release here.
It uses the original data files in order to work.
                                What is nice about this one is that it has some very fancy graphics effects added
                                on top of the old game engine without it resulting in any stylistic clashes.











LRPS2
LRPS2 is a PlayStation2 emulator. It has a brand-new Vulkan-powered LLE renderer called ParaLLEl GS.
                            ParaLLEl-GS' goal is to be as accurate as software rendering but using the GPU instead of the CPU. Thanks to this we can also do enhancements which would be too slow to do on software, such as supersampled antialiasing and other enhancements.
For more information, read our article on this release here.











DOSBox Pure
DOSBox Pure is an easy-to-use plug and play version of DOSBox written specifically for Libretro/RetroArch. It supports MS-DOS and Windows 9x games. You can use savestates and even rewind. Automatic  game detection with custom gamepad to keyboard mapping for many DOS games.
For more information, read our article on this release here.











PX68K
PX-68K is a Sharp X68000 emulator. This is a Japanese home computer from the late '80s/early '90s that was used by Capcom as devkits for their arcade games. It played host to many popular games from the likes of Namco, Konami and Capcom.
Core available now for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.
For more information, read our article on this release here.














Innovation
RetroArch has been first to market with many innovative features, some of which have became industry standard. Because of its dynamic nature as a rapidly evolving open source project, it continues adding new features on an annual basis.

Dynamically loadable programs (cores): Libretro as a backend technology allows RetroArch (or any frontend implementing the Libretro API) to run whatever multimedia program it wants as long as the lifecycle of the Libretro program is properly implemented. This main innovative feature has led to various other programs also adopting the Libretro API, making its emulator and game cores widely playable across various applications outside of just RetroArch
Dynamic audio rate control: An attempt at solving one of the age-old problems of audio and video sync while not having either crackling audio or massive frametime deviations. The method works by dynamically adjusting audio resampling ratios in such ways that ideally, the audio buffer is never underrun nor overrun, thus avoiding blocking on audio.
Runtime programmable pixel shaders on the GPU: Introduced in 2011, first supporting the Cg spec (now deprecated) and GLSL. Later on, a piece of middleware called SPIRV-Cross was developed so that a new shader spec (Slang) could allow us to run the same shaders regardless of the graphics API.
Runahead: Introduced in 2018, runahead is a sophisticated way of running the game in a second session. The end result of this when it works is a vast reduction in input and video latency without any perceivable ghosting issues.
AI text translation: This feature allows users to capture the current state of the game and feed it to a customizable endpoint for additional processing. With the help of OCR (optical character recognition) and other techniques, the AI service can provide a live translation of a game, or text-to-speech capabilities for the visually impaired among other things, either on demand or automatically.

Cross Platform
RetroArch can run on the usual platforms like Windows, macOS and Linux, but it stands alone in that it can support far more platforms beyond just that.
We support operating systems that not even Microsoft and Apple themselves support anymore, such as macOS on PowerPC Macs, and RetroArch being available on Windows OSes as far back as Windows 95.
On top of all that, RetroArch also runs on iOS and Android for tablets and phones, as well as on game consoles like PS2, PS3, PSP, PS Vita, Wii, Wii U, 2DS, 3DS, Switch, and more!
RetroArch is available on many popular store fronts for free, including Steam, Amazon App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei App Gallery, Apple Store and Google Play!
                The current stable version is: 1.22.1
Which version to go with?
We recommend the full-fat desktop version if you want all of RetroArch's capabilities plus a built-in updater.
Depending on your convenience though you could also grab a build from any of the App Stores we have published RetroArch on.
Be aware though that the capabilities of these versions may vary so that we can be in compliance with the policies of these app stores.
For instance, the Steam version requires us to host everything on their CDN and the cores we make available have to be provided on Steam themselves, so there is no daily automatic core updater available.
Not sure what version to get? Click on the 'Stable' button below for a stable build, or 'Nightly' for the latest daily release for your platform!

Steam
The Steam version is different from other versions of RetroArch. There is no Core Updater provided, no thumbnail scraping, and you have to download a select number of cores from Steam itself. This is to be in compliance with Valve's storefront rules.

Steam Link
Steam Link is not automatically built, this is the best version that works for now.

Stables might be months old. If you want an in-development version, we serve daily builds of RetroArch on our buildbot. We call these 'Nightly builds'. Click on the link down below to grab a nightly for your platform.
Nightly builds contain the latest commits available on GitHub, and the latest enhancements and features are added daily. This version may not be as stable as Stable version because it is built daily, but this does not mean that it is not stable. There are several files you can download in these folders. For a new installation you want RetroArch.7z or the setup package (RetroArch-20XX-XX-XX-setup.exe).

This shader is the work of Mark Rejhon from BlurBusters (blurbusters.com) and Timothy Lottes (creator of the original FXAA shader and the crt-lottes shaders). It leverages RetroArch’s recently added […]

Understanding Basics¶

RetroArch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players.
What RetroArch is¶
It runs programs converted into dynamic libraries called libretro cores, using several user interfaces such as command-line interface, a few graphical user interfaces optimized for gamepads, several input, audio and video drivers, plus other sophisticated features like dynamic rate control, audio filters, multi-pass shaders, netplay, gameplay rewinding, cheats, etc. Settings are also unified so configuration is done once and for all.
In addition to this, you are able to run original game discs (CDs) from RetroArch.
What RetroArch is not¶
RetroArch is not a computer program that includes all consoles and games. It is not a service that allows you to download copyrighted games or content. It is not an application that will cause you to modify the application to the platform on which you will install it, but in order to run unsigned applications on some platforms, the default firmware needs to be modified.
What is LibRetro¶
Libretro is a simple API that allows for the creation of games and emulators. It is very simple in nature, yet very powerful. The simplicity of it all requires some explanation in order to truly grasp how useful it can be to your own projects.
While the libretro API is simple in nature, it is also incredibly powerful. By using the libretro API, your program becomes a single library file, known as a 'libretro core', that can be loaded by any frontend that supports the libretro API. 
The beauty of this approach is that the frontend is responsible for providing all the implementation-specific details, such as video/audio/input drivers. This means that as a developer, you don't have to worry about writing different video drivers for Direct3D or OpenGL, or supporting all known joypads or input/sound APIs. All of these details are handled by the frontend, which frees up your time and energy to focus solely on creating the main program.
Additionally, the libretro API allows for cross-platform compatibility, meaning that a libretro core can be used on multiple platforms with minimal effort. This makes it an ideal choice for developers who want to create games or emulators that can be easily ported to different platforms.
In summary, the libretro API offers a simple yet powerful way to create games and emulators. By separating the implementation-specific details from the main program, the libretro API allows developers to focus on creating high-quality content without worrying about the underlying technical details.
Logo/Mascot¶

We call them Invader but you can call it Nice Little Pixel, it was drawn from scratch by talented Runar Heyer and it has a completely different visual style.

Start Point¶
RetroArch is a versatile emulator that has been successfully ported to a wide range of platforms. With its ability to run on numerous PC operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as home consoles like PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U, RetroArch offers a comprehensive gaming experience to its users. It is also compatible with handheld consoles like PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS, as well as smartphones running on Android and iOS. 
In addition to these platforms, RetroArch can also be run on single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi and ODROID. Moreover, with the use of the Emscripten compiler, RetroArch can even be accessed through web browsers. The latest stable version of RetroArch is 1.22.2, and it is regularly updated throughout the month to ensure optimal performance and compatibility. Whether you're a gaming enthusiast or a software developer, RetroArch is an excellent choice for emulating retro games and enjoying a nostalgic gaming experience.
Downloading¶
To get started with RetroArch, the first step is to download the application. While some systems may have RetroArch available in their official store or an alternative store, it's also possible to download it directly from the RetroArch website. When downloading, be sure to choose a trusted source that has been approved by LibRetro or is LibRetro itself to ensure a safe and reliable download. Don't hesitate to download from these sources as they are verified by the RetroArch community.

Example
WindowsAndroid


Store:

Steam
Itch.io

Main:

Buildbot



Store:

Google Play
Amazon

Main:

Buildbot




As you can see here, Google Play installation and distribution was made by LibRetro, while Amazon was done by Gadsby. This is a rare event. In some cases, we may need to perform the distribution outside of our original account. The reasons for this can be technical as well as bureaucratic. We report these situations and external uploads made on the link that we did not report or share do not belong to us.

Now that we've talked about our download sources, we can come to the download stages. You can use one of the two channels for this. One of them is our original website and the other is the buildbot where our application is produced. It downloads from the same source on both links, so you can use both.
After entering the website, you will encounter the situation where you can use one of the two download options. This applies for most platforms. These options are divided into two as Stable and Nightly. Let's get to know these options closely:
StableNightly


The stable version is our first priority and the main distribution version. Since it is the major release, it comes out periodically. Stable releases take more time to manufacture, but new features become available in the next version. For example: A version can have a new theme and feature, and in the next version, this theme and feature can be removed, improved or changed. As can be understood from the name of Stable, this version is more stable because it is controlled accordingly to make it work better on the platform it is suitable for.


This version contains the latest commits available on GitHub, and the latest enhancements and features are added daily. This version may not be as stable as Stable version because it is build daily, but this does not mean that it is not stable.



So how do you decide which of these options is right for you? This is hidden in the answer to one of the two questions below.



After you decide which version to install, you can go to the appropriate installation steps for your platform. 
If the installation is finished, you can continue with the love at first sight page.

Snes9x: Beyond Limits91 Concurrent sessions, 133 sessions today





Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
                emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES and Super
                Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation; which includes some real gems
                that were only ever released in Japan.

                Snes9x is the result of well over three years worth of part-time hacking, coding,
                recoding, debugging, divorce, etc. (just kidding about the divorce bit). Snes9x is coded
                in C++, with three assembler CPU emulation cores on the i386 Linux and Windows ports.Currently
                there are many ports of Snes9x available, please check the download page to see if a port
                exists for your system.

Latest Release: 0.10.5
Latest Development Version: 8899-4b26a2dc6


mGBA 0.10.5
Mar 8, 2025
A new release of mGBA, version 0.10.5 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes.
Though 0.10.4 was scheduled to be the last version before 0.11, some major issues were discovered and fixed.
Important fixes include save state loading leading to a small portion of the ROM getting corrupted until reset, which affected games including Golden Sun, the Wii version (and potentially other versions) crashing when loading from ZIP files that are too large, and another issue with the updater.
As this version only includes important fixes and smaller fixes that are unlikely to cause more issues the list of changes is small.
This will be the last release before 0.11 unless a major issue is discovered, and may be the last release to support Windows 7 – 8.1 and macOS 10.9 – 10.12.
An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.

mGBA 0.10.4
Dec 7, 2024
A new release of mGBA, version 0.10.4 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes.

If you are running on Windows and have used the installer (instead of the portable version),
you will need to update manually as a bug that prevents the built-in updater from working properly has only been identified and fixed after the release of 0.10.3.
This will be the last release before 0.11 unless a major issue is discovered, and may be the last release to support Windows 7 – 8.1 and macOS 10.9 – 10.12.
An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.

mGBA Turns Ten
Apr 3, 2023
Time sure does fly, huh? It’s been 10 years now since the very first commit to the mGBA git repository.
And while you can read all about the early history of mGBA on the timeline page, I can assure you I had no expectation I’d still be working on this ten years later.
But here we are, a decade later, and I’m still working on it.

mGBA 0.10.1
Jan 10, 2023
A new release of mGBA, version 0.10.1 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes. This release took a lot longer than expected, but hopefully it’ll be free of new bugs as a result. An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.

mGBA 0.10.0
Oct 11, 2022
Been a bit, huh?
It’s been 10 months since the last minor release, and over a year and a half since the last major release, but progress definitely has not stopped in the meantime.
Although a lot of the changes in this version are under the hood, cleaning up a lot of older code, paying down technical debt and fixing bugs, there are still some major new features in this release.
Maybe we spent a bit too long on the polish, though, since this release was intended to be released months ago.
Note also that mGBA is written primarily by a single developer, so at times progress can stagnate; after all, mGBA has a bus factor of one.
Fortunately, the extra-long wait is over, and mGBA 0.10.0 is here now!

Scripting support now available in dev builds
May 29, 2022
The highly-anticipated scripting feature, which has been in development for the past several months, has now been merged and is available in development builds.
With this merged, users can now write and run scripts in Lua, as is possible in some other emulators.
Currently, there is only preliminary support and many features are not yet exposed.
These builds include an example script that shows how to interact with the emulator, and can pull information about the party from the US releases of the first three Pokémon generations.
There is also documentation on the current API available on its own page.
As this feature is still nascent, we’re looking for feedback on how to improve it and what should be added in the future.
For this, there is now a #scripting channel in the Discord server (linked on the sidebar) to discuss writing scripts or requesting support or new features.
If you’ve wanted to write scripts for mGBA, now’s the time to start looking into it!
The current features are currently implemented:

Read/write access to emulator memory (via the full address space, or via memory domains) and registers
Save state saving and loading
Getting and updating the currently pressed buttons
Getting various informational state about the emulated game
Taking a screenshot to file
Various callbacks, such as per-frame, when the core is reset, right before keys are read, and more
Instruction advance, frame advance, and resetting the emulation state
A console for logging, and buffers for displaying textual information to the user

mGBA 0.9.3
Dec 17, 2021
A new release of mGBA, version 0.9.3 is available. This version is a bugfix release, which contains many important fixes. Importantly, random freezing with the OpenGL display driver, mostly when using fast forward, which had only partially been fixed in 0.9.2, should now be properly fixed. An extensive list of changes follows after the cut.

    FAQs
  
  




  
  
    General ⬨


  
  
    What is mGBA? ⬨

mGBA is a new generation of Game Boy Advance emulator. The project started in April 2013 with the goal of being fast enough to run on lower end hardware than other emulators support, without sacrificing accuracy or portability. Even in the initial version, games generally played without problems. mGBA has only gotten better since then, and now boasts being the most accurate GBA emulator around.
Further along in development mGBA gained Game Boy support and eventually is planned to have DS support too. Other goals include accurate enough emulation to provide a development environment for homebrew software, a good workflow for tool-assist runners, and a modern feature set for emulators that older emulators may not support.

  
  
    What are the system requirements for mGBA? ⬨

mGBA will run on mostly any computer from the last decade, as well as several additional platforms:

Windows (7 or newer)
macOS
Linux
*BSD
Nintendo 3DS (New 3DS is required for GBA games)
Nintendo Switch
Wii
PlayStation Vita

If you wish to run mGBA on other systems that RetroArch runs on please use the libretro core instead. Please note that the libretro core is not always in sync with the standalone version and may have issues no longer present upstream.

  
  
    Will there be an Android or iOS version? ⬨

We hope so! But as it stands no one who works on mGBA is an Android or iOS developer, which makes creating a quality port difficult. There have been several attempts towards making an Android version before, to varying degrees of success and quality, but none of these ports ever really got off the ground.
If you’re an Android or iOS developer and want to help work on an official Android port of mGBA, please talk to us in #development on the mGBA Discord! There’s an invite link to the Discord on the sidebar, if you’re not there already.

  
  
    What does the m stand for? ⬨

It doesn’t. mGBA was originally going to be named miniGBA but as the project grew the “mini” appellation became less accurate. The name was intended to be temporary, but as the original release crept closer I couldn’t think of any better names. Other working names for mGBA included GBAc and Gerboa, but nothing else stuck.

  
  
    How do I file a bug? ⬨

The best way is to sign up an account on GitHub and post on the issue tracker. If you’re using 0.9.0 or newer on PC please use the built-in bug report tool to generate a zip file to attach to the report. Otherwise, please include the version you’re using (including the numbers and letters, if you’re using a development build), what OS you’re running on, and the names of games affected.

  
  
    What is the license for mGBA? ⬨

mGBA is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, and the code can be found on GitHub.

  
  
    How do I compile mGBA? ⬨

Please see the README for detailed information.

  
  
    Features ⬨


  
  
    How good is compatibility? ⬨

mGBA emulates two platforms currently, with the work-in-progress medusa version supporting a third:

Game Boy Advance emulation is currently very good. There are known bugs with some games, but there are no games that don’t boot.
Game Boy/Game Boy Color emulation is good. Most games work but there are still plenty of bugs. Please file a bug if you find a game that doesn’t boot.
DS support is very early with poor compatibility at the moment, and only available in the medusa branch, which is not currently under active development.

Current bugs can be found on GitHub for GBA, GB/C and DS

  
  
    What peripherals and cartridge types does mGBA support? ⬨

Please see the README for current status, but most GBA peripherals are supported:

Rumble (cartridge and Game Boy Player)
Rotation/tilt (accelerometer and gyroscope)
Solar sensor (for Boktai)
Realtime clock
Link cable (partial support)
BattleChip Gate (for Mega Man Battle Network)

And some GB peripherals and special cartridge types are supported:

Rumble
Tilt (MBC7)
Realtime clock
Game Boy Printer
Game Boy Camera (partial support)
Super Game Boy (partial support)
MBC6 (partial support)
MMM01 (partial support)
TAMA5 (partial support)
HuC-1 (partial support)
HuC-3 (partial support)

The following are not supported at the time:

Wireless Adapter
IR Adapter (for Zoids: Cyberdrive)
Soul Adapter (for Legendz)


  
  
    Troubleshooting ⬨


  
  
    On loading a game I only get a white screen ⬨

Try changing the audio driver in settings. If all else fails turn on Sync to video and off Sync to audio.

  
  
    I did something and now the game always runs too fast! ⬨

Make sure Fast forward is unchecked under emulation and at least one of Sync to audio or Sync to video is checked. I recommend Sync to audio only.

  
  
    I’m on Windows and my games won’t save ⬨

Make sure your ROMs are in a location that isn’t write protected or requires UAC to modify files. For example, do not put them under Program Files, even if mGBA is installed there.

  
  
    I put games in Program Files and now I can’t find my saves ⬨

If your save games do end up working while the ROMs are in Program Files, you will probably have trouble finding where the save files wind up. Due to some questionable design choices made back in Windows Vista, your save files have probably wound up in the obscure directory %LocalAppData%\VirtualStore.

  
  
    On loading a game I get a black screen ⬨

Try changing the display driver from OpenGL to OpenGL (Force 1.x) or Software.

  
  
    mGBA has issues with my controller ⬨

At this time mGBA’s controller support is lackluster. Improvements are planned but if using a controller is your utmost concern you may want to use the libretro core instead.

  
  
    Directional input is stuck even when I’m not pressing any keys ⬨

Try seeing if a game controller is detected in Settings > Controllers. Things that aren’t controllers are sometimes mis-detected, and may cause issues like this.
If one does show up, you should try clicking on the text boxes for the D-Pad buttons and hitting both clear analog and clear button to prevent any erroneous inputs from being detected.

  
  
    Where are setting stored? ⬨

For the portable version, settings are stored in config.ini and qt.ini in the same directory as the emulator executable itself.
For the installer version and homebrew platforms, it depends on the OS:

Windows: %APPDATA%/mGBA
macOS and *nix: ~/.config/mgba (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mgba if set)
3DS, Switch, Wii: /mGBA
Vita: ux0:/data/mGBA


  
  
    Gameplay or audio is stuttery ⬨

If you’re using the PC version, try adjusting your sync settings (Sync to audio only is recommended) or your audio buffer settings. Sometimes switching the audio driver also helps.
However, if you’re using either the 3DS or Vita versions, you’re basically out of luck. Both devices are underpowered and just barely too slow to run mGBA at full speed in all circumstances.
We’re aware of the problem and are trying to fix it, but there’s no guarantee it’s fixable.

  
  
    Audio isn’t working in the 3DS version ⬨

Current versions of mGBA for 3DS require the DSP blob to be dumped for audio to work. There are various utilities available online to do this, such as DSP1 or DspDump.

  
  
    Glossary ⬨

mGBA’s development uses some project-specific names for things that may be confusing. Here’s a list of the most common ones:

CInema: A suite of automated regression tests of video output, akin to Dolphin’s fifoci
Input revamp: Upcoming rewrite of the input and controller mapping, meant to improve many of the fundamental issues present
medusa: mGBA’s upcoming DS support
mGUI: The UI used on all the homebrew ports
mGUI2: mGBA’s upcoming enhanced homebrew UI
mNP: mGBA’s upcoming netplay support and link cable rewrite
Orca: Upcoming mGBA/Dolphin integration for GBA link and GB Player
XQ audio: High-level mixing of the MP2k (Music Player 2000, sometimes erroneously called M4A or Sappy) audio engine for higher quality audio
