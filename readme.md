## 🕹️ **RetroTune AI: The Expert Retrogaming QA Assistant**

## **<i>Important Notice</i>: This project is being evaluated so it is still subject to changes if ordered by the bootcamp's teachers**

### **Project Overview**

RetroTune AI is a specialized, hybrid conversational agent designed to solve the complex technical challenges of modern retrogaming. It provides bespoke advice on tuning classic video games and emulators (like PCSX2, Dolphin, and RetroArch) for modern hardware, such as 4K displays and high-refresh-rate monitors.

The agent operates using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combined with dynamic Google Search, ensuring it provides accurate, up-to-date, and context-specific configuration advice.


### 🚀 **Technical Summary and Architecture**

1. Core Components

Agent Framework: The system is built on LangChain, which orchestrates advanced tools, and uses GPT-3.5-turbo as the "Brain" for optimal speed and reasoning.

User Interface: The user interface is a web link deployed via Gradio, ensuring a user-friendly chat experience.

Tracing & Evaluation: LangSmith is used for visibility into the agent's thought process (tracing) and for running automated evaluation metrics.

2. Hybrid Tooling (The Architecture)

The Agent operates as a ReAct Agent, selecting the best tool based on the user's query:

Internal Knowledge (RAG): We use ChromaDB as our local Vector Store to persistently hold embeddings (generated by text-embedding-ada-002) of our curated technical dataset. This tool is prioritized for stable, foundational knowledge.

External Knowledge (Search): External, real-time knowledge is fetched dynamically using the Google Search API integrated via LangChain's search wrapper. This tool is used as a fallback for niche or rapidly-changing information (e.g., "latest best PCSX2 settings in 2025").

3. Agent Flow and Prompt

The agent utilizes a detailed system prompt to enforce a critical conversational flow:

Platform Choice: The agent immediately prompts the user to specify if they are using PC/Mac (Emulator) or Native Console Hardware.

Spec Gathering (PC/Mac): If PC/Mac is chosen, the agent critically asks for the user's CPU, GPU, RAM, and monitor resolution before providing advice.

Advice Generation: Once context is gathered, the agent uses its RAG/Search tools to formulate the best tuning advice.

### **💾 Dataset and Ingestion Pipeline**

The project's knowledge base is crucial for specialized advice.

Data Sources:

YouTube Transcripts: Technical guides and tutorials ingested using the YoutubeLoader.

Official Documentation: Emulator configuration wikis (e.g., PCSX2, Dolphin) scraped using WebBaseLoader.

Preprocessing & Storage:

Chunking: Documents were split using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter into chunks of 1000 tokens with an overlap of 150 to maintain semantic continuity.

Embedding: Chunks were embedded using text-embedding-ada-002.

Vector Store: All processed embeddings are stored in the persistent local vector database, ChromaDB (chroma_db_retrogaming/).

### **📚 Key Resources (Source Knowledge)**

The core knowledge base consists of specialized technical information:

Emulator Documentation: Official configuration guides for PCSX2, Dolphin, and RetroArch.

Video Tutorials: Transcripts from expert YouTube channels covering retro-hardware upscaling (e.g., OSSC, RetroTINK) and emulator optimization techniques.

Dynamic Source: Google Search API provides real-time access to the latest patches and community findings not present in the static RAG database.

### **🧪 Evaluation**

The quality of the conversational agent was rigorously tested using an automated evaluation pipeline:

The evaluation process was significantly advanced beyond simple qualitative assessment by implementing an automated pipeline that utilized LangSmith and the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology (powered by GPT-4o).

Metrics Tracked:

Correctness: Validated against ground truth answers using the LLM-as-a-Judge pattern.

Relevance: Measured the lexical overlap between the question and the agent's final answer.

Similarity: Measured the lexical similarity between the prediction and the human-defined ground truth.

Improvement: Evaluation runs helped fine-tune the system prompt, specifically by enforcing the priority of RAG over Google Search for stable configuration data.
